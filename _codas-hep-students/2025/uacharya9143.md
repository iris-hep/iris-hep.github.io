## My research:
I am currently working on the OO collision analysis for the study of Jet Quenching from the 2025 data using CMS Detector. Additionally, I am working on inclusive Jet Modification using Run3 data.

## My expertise is:
My expertise lies in the phi meson analysis.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
The problem I have is that I have not used python. I know its basics. But for the larger analysis framework,I have a long way to go.

## I've got my eyes on:
To understand more of Python and Machine learning.

## I want to know more about:
I want to know more about python programming in the large data analysis and its applicability in Machine Learning and other high volume data analysis.
