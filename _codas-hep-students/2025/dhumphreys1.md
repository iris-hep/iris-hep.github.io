## My research:
My primary analysis is a search for Higgs light resonances. Specifically I am conducting a search for the process $S\rightarrow Z_d Z_d \rightarrow \ell\ell\nu\nu$, utilizing parameterized neural networks. I am also working on a GNN implemented level 0 trigger for the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

## My expertise is:
- General data analysis.
    - Familiar with multiple neural network architectures
    - Processing raw binary data
    - Proficient in object oriented programming with Python and C++
- Being thrown on to new projects I know nothing about.
- Arguing with chatgpt

## A problem I'm grappling with:
How to transition a GNN from being a hit classifier to an edge/track classifier

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning about heterogenous processing. I find GPU's to be really fascinating and have potential for very large preformance improvements.

## I want to know more about:
I'd like to dig deeper into Graphical Neural Networks and Transformers. It would be really cool to build my own LLM.
