## My research:
I am working on improving NOvA Detector interaction vertexing using Regression based CNN

## My expertise is:
Deep Learning

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I am still figuring out how to use ROOT and CAFANA to analyze my trained model in the NOvA art framework.

## I've got my eyes on:
Improving the vertexing in NOvA detector reconstruction using CNN.
Contributing to DUNE software and computing group.

## I want to know more about:
ML techniques in HEP
