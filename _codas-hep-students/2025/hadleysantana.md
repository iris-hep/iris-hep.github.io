## My research:
I work on Higgs physics and flavor tagging for the ATLAS collaboration.

## My expertise is:
Calibrating ML algorithms on data.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Setting standards as a maintainer of my analysis code that will keep it functional and well-documented without driving other people who work on it insane.

## I've got my eyes on:
Writing my thesis!

## I want to know more about:
GPU programming, optimizing analysis code for efficiency, not letting two-factor authentication drive me insane every day
