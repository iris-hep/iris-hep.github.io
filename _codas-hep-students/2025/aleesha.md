## My research:

- Contributed to the pMSSM reinterpretation of Run 2 CMS results, focusing on providing stau inputs.
- Worked as an encapsulation technician at the Module Assembly Center (CMU) for the CMS HGCAL upgrade.
- Currently developing a Run 3 analysis framework targeting stau leptons in the all-hadronic channel 
using Coffea 2025.

## My expertise is:
Python, C++ and worked with several domain-specific softwares during my undergrad.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
- In search of a helper function in matplotlib to compute uncertainties on data/MC ratio plots for 
trigger efficiency studies—similar to the TEfficiency utility in ROOT.

## I've got my eyes on:
New upgrades in Coffea 

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming and GPU programming
