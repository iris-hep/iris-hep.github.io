## My research:
At the Project 8 Experiment, we work on measuring the neutrino mass scale by capturing electrons from tritium beta decay and analyzing the end-point energy. My focus is on leveraging modern data science and AI/ machine learning techniques to process and analyze the experiment's large datasets and extract meaningful science. I also contribute to the design and simulation of resonant cavities and high-precision electromagnetic traps used in the detection process.

## My expertise is:
Simulation, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Hardware Design and Optimization

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I'm working on developing a physics-informed diffusion model to generate synthetic electron cyclotron signals that captures the complex motion of electrons in electromagnetic fields. The challenge lies in combining constraints with machine learning to create realistic, high-fidelity signals.

## I've got my eyes on:
Quantum computing and how quantum algorithms will change the computational physics world.

## I want to know more about:
Physics informed machine learning techniques, quantum algorithms, and their applications in fields beyond physics.
