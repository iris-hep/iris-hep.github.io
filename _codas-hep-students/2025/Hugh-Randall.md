## My research:
I'm a cosmology student, currently using the DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) Year 1 data to measure primordial non-gaussianity with the large scale structure.

## My expertise is:
I have the most experience developing data analysis pipelines in Python.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I'm working to mitigate systematic uncertainties to further constrain the measurements of our parameters of interest.

## I've got my eyes on:
Machine learning approaches in cosmology and astrophysics.

## I want to know more about:
Generally increasing my code efficiency. Specifically, I'd like to learn more about parallelization and how to optimize code for large data sets.
