## My research:
I am currently working in an analysis for the measurements of spin correlations and quantum correlations in top quark pair (ttbar) production within CMS using Run2 and Run3 data.

## My expertise is:
Top quark physics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
How to construct an efficient columnar analysis python framework for a large analysis.

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning how to construct an analysis framework in the most optimized and flexible way possible.

## I want to know more about:
Parallelization techniques and machine learning techniques for HEP
