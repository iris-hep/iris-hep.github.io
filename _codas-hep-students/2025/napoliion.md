## My research:
I work on the XENONnT dark matter direct detection experiment where I get to collaborate with a ton of awesome folks around the world. Most of my projects and side quests involve applying machine learning to improve our data pipeline.

## My expertise is:
ML applications for time projection chambers (TPCs). Although I wouldn't say I am an expert, I've worked most with autoencoders for anomaly detection, sequence-to-sequence methods for time-series data, and normalizing flows for probabilistic inference.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Using normalizing flows to model electric fields and to probabilistically reconstruct interaction positions. Also trying to grow plants in my fish tank.

## I've got my eyes on:
Thesis writing and job apps (knock on wood!).

## I want to know more about:
GPU programming, how other HEP experiments apply computational methods for their analyses and unique computing needs, and AI tools.
