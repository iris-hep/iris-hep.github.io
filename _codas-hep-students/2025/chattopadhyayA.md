## My research:
My research interests are quite varied. I get attracted to problems having challenging mathematical undertones, possibly allowing some algebraic geometry approach. This brought me closer to a lot of mathematical physics issues and specially string theory. At present I am working at the interface of theoretical physics and AI-driven experimental particle physics. By integrating machine-learning tools into both my formal studies (holography/mathematical physics) and hands-on work with Large hadron Collider open data, I am researching to bridge deep theory with real-time data applications.

## My expertise is:
Mathematical physics and data analysis in python.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
To have enough computing power to run all my ideas simultaneously.

## I've got my eyes on:
Creating newer physics informed machine learning architectures both for particle physics and mathematical physics.

## I want to know more about:
Parallel processing and synthetic data generation.
