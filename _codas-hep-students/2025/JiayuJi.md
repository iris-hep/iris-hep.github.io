## My research:
T2K neutrino experiment.
I worked on the upgraded near detector of the T2K experiment, focusing on the Super Fine-Grained Detector (SFGD). I participated in the construction, commissioning, and calibration of the SFGD. I am now analyzing beam data collected by the upgraded near detectors.

## My expertise is:
C++, Python, ROOT. Bayesian analysis.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Understanding the data/MC discrepancies in the SFGD detector and evaluating the associated detector systematics.

## I've got my eyes on:
New methods for the high energy experiment data analysis.

## I want to know more about:
Apply AI techniques to high energy experiments.
