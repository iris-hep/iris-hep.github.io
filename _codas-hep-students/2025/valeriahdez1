## My research:
Mathematical modeling to understand how different RNA–protein complexes can form distinct or coexisting biomolecular condensates (droplets) through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS).mathematical model to understand how different RNA–protein complexes can form distinct or coexisting biomolecular condensates (droplets) through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS).

## My expertise is:
Theoretical biophysics and computational modeling, with a focus on applying allometric scaling laws and continuum models to understand biological organization and phase behavior.

## I want to know more about:
Tools and techniques in data science and machine learning that can enhance my modeling of biological systems.
