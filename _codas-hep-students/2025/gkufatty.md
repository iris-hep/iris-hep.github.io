## My research:
Neutron Multiplicity from Neutrino Interactions in DUNE-ND 2x2 Prototype.

## My expertise is:
I would not call myself an expert but working on experimental neutrino physics and energy reconstruction from LArTPC.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Improve neutron tagging techniques in LArTPCs.

## I've got my eyes on:
Complementing my research with Machine Learning and improve my computational skills.

## I want to know more about:
Machine Learning, data science, and overall improving my computational skills for my research!
