### Biography and Interests

I am a fourth year physics PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, working on the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection dark matter experiment.

### My research:
I am engaged in several analysis projects in the LZ experiment, including a search for Be7 solar neutrino interactions within our liquid xenon target. In addition, I perform calibrations for the LZ experiment, specifically position-based pulse area corrections and electric field mapping.

### My expertise is:
Python data analysis and scripting.

### A problem that I am grappling with:
ML-based data analysis: can I use machine learning algorithms to improve the efficiency of solar neutrino detection in LZ?

### I've got my eyes on:
Graduating! Only two years out....

### I want to know more about:
Software-hardware code design, including GPUs and FPGAs!
