## My research:
I work on short-baseline sterile neutrino searches using the NOvA experiment.

## My expertise is:
Neutrino oscillation analysis, ROOT and CAFAna-based data processing, grid computing for high-energy physics, and statistical tools for χ² surface generation.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Efficiently separating signal from background in high-statistics samples, and understanding the systematic impact of different reconstruction algorithms between production versions.

## I've got my eyes on:
Advancing oscillation sensitivity studies using updated flux and cross-section models, and improving automation of sterile neutrino parameter scans.

## I want to know more about:
Machine learning integration in neutrino event classification and best practices in reproducible HEP analysis pipelines.
