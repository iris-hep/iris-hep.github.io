## My research:
Measurements of long-baseline neutrino oscillations with the NOvA experiment.

## My expertise is:
Neutrino oscillations, data-driven constraints, and analysis workflows.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Balancing the stability of long-used code with the need to adapt and improve it.

## I've got my eyes on:
Enhancing sensitivity through smarter use of available data.

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming and how to improve performance in simulation and fitting.
