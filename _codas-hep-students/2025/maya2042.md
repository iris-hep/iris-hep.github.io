## My research:
Some projects I'm working on now include N-body simulations of the early cold classical Kuiper Belt, X-ray spectral analysis of Active Galactic Nuclei, and MIR spectroscopy to solve the orbits of young stars.

## My expertise is:
Large-scale simulations

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Getting good cross-correlations from spectra from the KPF instrument for an unsolved multiple-star system.

## I want to know more about:
Applying AI tools to astrophysics problems
