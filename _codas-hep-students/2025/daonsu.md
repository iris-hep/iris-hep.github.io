## My research:
I have worked on the Muon g-2 Experiment at Fermilab. As the experiment is completed, I'm moving on to the Axion Dark Matter Experiment (ADMX).

## My expertise is:
Precision muon physics, calorimeter data analysis, nonlinear regression.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Learning everything about my new project - axion dark matter cavity haloscopes.

## I've got my eyes on:
AI/ML trend in particle & nuclear & astrophysics community.

## I want to know more about:
Deep learning and its general application to physics, especially in my research. It could be operation optimization, (spectral) signal processing, excess significance determination optimization, etc.
