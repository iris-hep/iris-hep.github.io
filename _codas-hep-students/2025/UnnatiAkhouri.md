## My research:
I work on open quantum systems dynamics. Specifically, I work on evolution of qubit networks and studying few-body subsystem ensembles within the full network. Some measures I work with are mutual information, entropy, Krylov complexity, concurrence and parameters of the one-qubit dynamical maps.

## My expertise is:
Qubit dynamical maps, quantum circuits and computational techniques for quantum networks.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Characterizing many body quantum systems evolution as a linear combination of operator spreading of Pauli Operators (basis operators that space N-qubit Hilbert space). This is an expensive computation so I am trying to understand ways to use symmetries to reduce computations and making he code compatible with the GPU resources at Penn State.

## I've got my eyes on:
Using Machine learning techniques to improve data analysis and parameter exploration pipeline.

## I want to know more about:
Machine learning, data management, code-compatibility for GPU processing.
