## My research:
I work as part of the EMPHATIC collaboration which operates at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) to characterize hadron production and scattering around the test-beam. This work is done in an effort to minimize flux uncertainties to help with the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE).

## My expertise is:
Signal processing techniques for sensor arrays.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Applying machine learning (ML) techniques to calibrating detector arrays.

## I've got my eyes on:
ML techniques to utilize in the signal processing to data acquisition pipeline.

## I want to know more about:
How to use ML for data acquisition and analysis.
