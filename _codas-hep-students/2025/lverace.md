## My research:
I am currently working on a search for a six-quark (uuddss) bound state particle called the sexaquark in the CMS experiment. I am also involved in a computing project focused on building a system for testing how current network connections between CMS computing sites perform when attempting to transfer HL-LHC level data volumes.

## My expertise is:
Computer networking, containerization, teaching and presenting physics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I just started my work on the sexaquark search this summer, so it has been a challenging but exciting journey to understand everything that has been done on it already.

## I've got my eyes on:
Finishing classes, starting my thesis analysis, moving to CERN and becoming involved in a hardware project.

## I want to know more about:
The CMS detector components, statistics for physics analyses, QFT, cooking.
