## My research:
I worked on a CMS Run-2 search for dark matter with mono-Higgs(bb) signature. Currently, I'm working on a CMS Run-3 measurement of Standard Model ZH process, using a neural network model to improve signal/background separation. I have some experience with a muon collider detector simulation studies, particularly with jet reconstruction performance in presence of the beam-induced background originating from muon decays.

## My expertise is:
Collider searches for dark matter; using columnar analysis framework. Some experience using muon collider software (adapted from CLIC).

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Using tools to write clean code and modular workflow. Locating relevant recommendations for Run-3 analysis.

## I've got my eyes on:
Writing thesis and post-doc applications! Learning about ML based models in order to improve sensitivity to new physics signatures.

## I want to know more about:
The popular ML models used in ongoing LHC data analyses, their strengths and limitations. Easy to pickup tools to use in my analysis.
