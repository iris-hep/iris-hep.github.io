## My research:
My research is focused on the study of substructure of QCD jets observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). In particular I am studying the time evolution of jet formation through measurements of Energy-Energy Correlators in proton-proton Collisions at CM = 510 GeV .

## My expertise is:
Most of my work relies on computational analysis in C++ and python. I dabble a bit in simulation studies of Monte Carlo event generators for Particle Physics in particular PYTHIA.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Currently I am grapping with how to properly integrate multiple data set into a single analysis.

## I've got my eyes on:
New signatures of possible beyond SM physics such as recent measurements of the magnetic moment of the Muon at the g-2 experiment.

## I want to know more about:
Machine Learning Techniques in the field of High Energy Physics.
