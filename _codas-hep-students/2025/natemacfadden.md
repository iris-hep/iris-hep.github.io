## My research:
I work in the Liam McAllister group. We study compactifications of string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds using the software CYTools. This software boils down to efficient algorithms on regular triangulations of reflexive polytopes and optimization in high-dimensional polyhedral fans. I develop/maintain this software.

## My expertise is:
Regular triangulations of reflexive polytopes. Convex cones. Polyhedral fans.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Finding (as many as possible) roots of highly structured functions in O(100) dimensions, as quickly as possible.

## I've got my eyes on:
Wrapping up existing projects so I can focus on said root finding.

## I want to know more about:
Learning ML, specifically in areas where it outperforms non-ML algorithms. Specific areas of interest are reinforcement learning and transformers.
