## My research:
I am currently involved in searches for heavy resonances decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons, with bb tau tau in the final state. In the near future, I will also be contributing to CMS trigger operations.

## My expertise is:
While I wouldn’t claim to be an expert just yet, after spending a considerable amount of time working on CMS analyses, I’ve become quite comfortable using PyROOT.   

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Convincing my collaborators that Coffea offers advantages over PyROOT for CMS Run 3 analyses and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

## I've got my eyes on:
Getting more sleep :) Also, passing my PhD preliminary exam to gain dissertator status and contributing to CMS trigger operations, both online and offline.

## I want to know more about:
Using artificial intelligence effectively and responsibly in research. I’m also interested in learning about various machine learning algorithms applied to object reconstruction, identification, and searches within the CMS experiment.
