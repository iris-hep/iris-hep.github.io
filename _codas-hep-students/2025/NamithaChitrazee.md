## My research:
I am part of the Mu2e and ICARUS experiments, based at Fermilab.

## My expertise is:
Performing simulations using Geant4, developing pattern recognition algorithms for particle track reconstruction,
analysis using ROOT, gaseous detectors

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Understanding the ML based Pandora and SPINE reconstruction software used by several neutrino experiments

## I've got my eyes on:
Use of ML in HEP: particle identification, reconstruction and analyses

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming and ML techniques that can be used in track reconstruction and particle identification
