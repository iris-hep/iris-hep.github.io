## My research:
I'm working with the ATLAS collaboration on event-by-event flow harmonic analysis in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.

## My expertise is:
ROOT, C++, unfolding techniques, and statistical methods in high energy physics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Handling statistical fluctuations in response matrices and improving unfolding stability.

## I've got my eyes on:
Theoretical QCD, QGP hydrodynamics, and experimental data modeling.

## I want to know more about:
Jet quenching, flow fluctuations, and ML applications in collider physics.
