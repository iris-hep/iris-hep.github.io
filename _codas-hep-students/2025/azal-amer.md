## My research:
I am developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish ALPs from background photons using calorimeter simulation data. My work focuses on optimizing sparse convolution architectures and multi-task learning approaches to improve classification performance across different mass ranges.

## My expertise is:
Convolutional Neural Networks

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Identifying why improving the distinguishibility in the spectrum of features reduces the performance of a my model to classify.

## I've got my eyes on:
Improving the readability and documentation surrounding my work, along with revisiting some of my older tests on newer code.

## I want to know more about:
Using existing tools to interpret information about the features neural networks I train, extract.
