## My research:
I am currently working on searches for beyond-the-Standard-Model physics in all-hadronic final states using Run 3 data with anomaly detection triggers
and scouting data in the CMS experiment. I am also involved in efforts to port MC event generators onto hardware accelerators like GPGPUs and vector CPUs and integrating them with the CMS Monte Carlo production framework.

## My expertise is:
Building data analysis tools in Python and programming heterogeneous architectures.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
The lack of clear, accessible, and well-written documentation for really important tools and methodologies used in our experiments.

## I've got my eyes on:
The computing challenges posed by the High-Luminosity LHC, and developing analysis techniques inspired by cutting-edge research in computer science.

## I want to know more about:
How to structure HEP frameworks, and writing clean & optimized code
