## My research:
Computational materials science applied to sustainable materials

## My expertise is:
Python, Ai/ML, DFT calculation

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Leveraging ML and parallel processing for better computational efficiency

## I've got my eyes on:
I’m interested in learning novel parallelization and computational tools used in HEP, which can also be applied to computational materials science research.

## I want to know more about:
I want to strengthen my understanding of simulations and statistical methods to support computational materials science, and I’m eager to learn how modern software tools can accelerate experimental research
