## My research:
I work on xenon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) experiments aimed at finding dark matter, particularly Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), such as the XENONnT detector. Additionally, I work with smaller TPCs designed to test this technology. My main focus is on using unsupervised neural networks for signal classification. Previously, I also maintained our metadata management software.

## My expertise is:
My expertise are on unsupervised neural networks and metadata management.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
A current challenge I'm facing is finding a method to extract quantitative information from a small TPC experiment where no simulation data is available.

## I've got my eyes on:
I aim to start working on software designed to aid physics experiments.

## I want to know more about:
I want to learn more about designing software for experiments, and I am keen to deepen my understanding of simulations and statistics.
