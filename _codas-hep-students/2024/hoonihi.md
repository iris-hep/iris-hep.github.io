## My research:
Electron scattering and transport in condensed matter, particularly in liquid water at elevated temperatures

## My expertise is:
Scientific computing, Python, Monte Carlo methods

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Analyzing the sensitivity of various parameters affecting the scattering characteristics of electrons

## I've got my eyes on:
More convenient and efficient tools

## I want to know more about:
ML techniques that can be applied to stochastic modeling in radiation chemistry and chemical physics
