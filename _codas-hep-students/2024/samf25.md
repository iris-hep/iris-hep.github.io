## My research:
My research has been surrounding a future Muon Collider. Specifically, I have been working with MC simulations and the reconstruction/analysis pipeline.

## My expertise is:
Python and C. Other languages include: Java, C++, Julia, LaTeX, Bash, R (Studio), MATLAB, and ROOT.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Currently, I am working on migrating the Muon Collider analysis pipeline from ILSoft to Key4HEP. This involves going from Marlin to Gaudi and from LCIO to edm4HEP.

## I've got my eyes on:
The arXiv.

## I want to know more about:
Everything related to high energy physics! I'm new to all of this and still learning (just started this year). I still have lots to learn.
