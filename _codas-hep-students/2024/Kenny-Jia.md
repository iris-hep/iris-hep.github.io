## My research:
Collider physics at Energy Frontier. BSM physics search, Future Colliders, and ML application in HEP.

## My expertise is:
- C++, python, ROOT, Delphes, Tcl
- Hardware aware AI/ML 
- being lazy (let LLM write code for me)

## A problem I'm grappling with:
- Stability of ML models.

## I've got my eyes on:
- foundation models for physics
- Fast ML
- ML application in HEP

## I want to know more about:
- Version control
- Dealing with memory issue for large datasets
- GNN, Transformer, and foundation model
