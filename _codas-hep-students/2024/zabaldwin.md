## My research:
Analyzing two-psuedoscalar systems in the search for exotic hybrid mesons at GlueX emphasizing:
- Partial Wave Analyses
- Moment Analyses
- Machine Learning

## My expertise is:
- Amplitude Analysis
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Multivariate Data Analysis
- Always missing several `}` in my C++ code

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Regression Analysis Methods utlizing regularization to improve model performance

## I've got my eyes on:
Anything involving Deep Neural Networks or icecream

## I want to know more about:
The High Luminosity-LHC and the implementation of deep learning techniques to enhance data analyses. Also, how to properly use git...
