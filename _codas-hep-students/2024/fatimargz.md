## My research:
I work on documenting the user experience of the RNTuple format for physics analyses frameworks in ATLAS. :)

## My expertise is:
Python, C++, ROOT

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Constantly questioning if there is a more efficient and optimized version of my code.

## I've got my eyes on:
High-Luminocity LHC, BSM physics and potential muon collider!

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming, ML, performance tuning and optimization tools
