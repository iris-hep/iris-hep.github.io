## My research:
I work with CMS and have worked on several Tracking projects with the goal of
improving tracking reconstruction in Run 3 and beyond using CNN and DNN. My
current analysis is about boosted Higgs decay to 2 pseudoscalars (same mass)
  decaying to 4 b (H -> aa -> 4b) and I've been training a Particle Net
  tagger and mass regressor in the context of this analysis.

## My expertise is:
CMS Tracking, currently Machine Learning contact of the Tracking POG.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I have quite a few related to my analysis, but that's an average work day.

## I've got my eyes on:
My thesis, I'm starting my 6th year..

## I want to know more about:
Optimizing my scripts to be memory efficient and make better use of GPUs and other resources.
