## My research:
I started working with Indiana University on the ATLAS Experiment in February. I work on the phase-II upgrade to the L1 trigger as well as searching for diHiggs processes. Prior to this I was involved in searches for supersymmetric particles and searches for new bosons coupling to dark matter.

## My expertise is:
Python, C++, being adaptable.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Writing clean and efficient code, multi-tasking.

## I've got my eyes on:
Columnar analyses and RDataFrames/Uproot

## I want to know more about:
Machine Learning and data tools in python. Efficiently processing large datasets.
