## My research:
I have been working on upgrades to the ATLAS experiment for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN. Specifically, I have been working on a component of the inner-most part of the detector, the Inner TracKer (ITk). Of parts in the ITk, I have helped develop thermal quality control metrics for staves which are the support structure/electrical housing for module detectors. I am beginning to start a Long-Lived Particle (LLP) search for displaced jets for Run 2 and partial Run 3 data from the LHC.

## My expertise is:
I am proficient in silicon strip detector assembly and testing.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I would like to understand better how I can develop specific triggers to search for exotic particle signatures.

## I've got my eyes on:
I am continuing to build and test components for the ITk. I would love to design a trigger that can be optimized for specific LLP searches.

## I want to know more about:
