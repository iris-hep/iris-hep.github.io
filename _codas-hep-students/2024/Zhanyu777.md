## My research:
Higgs Boson Decaying into charm quarks data analysis.

## My expertise is:
I only have a superficial understanding of Python, C++, and machine learning. I'm really a newbie.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Getting higher sensitivity on top quarks + Higgs decaying into charm quarks.
## I've got my eyes on:
Using Machine Learning to do data analysis

## I want to know more about:
Monte Carlo Simulations, Machine Learning.
