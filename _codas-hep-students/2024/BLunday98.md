## My research:
- (Ongoing) Searching for Stealth Supersymmetry in squark/gluino production channels at the LHC
- Development of an ML-based approach to the Jet Energy Scale (JES) and pileup calibration in ATLAS
- Characterizing static/time-based pixel readout systems for the DUNE far detector

## My expertise is:
-Â Detector hardware characterization and development
- Data processing, analysis, and visualization using Python (pandas, skl, seaborn)
- Developing machine learning networks (DNNs mainly) to tackle physics optimization problems
- Spending hours trying to tweak plots in ROOT

## A problem I'm grappling with:
- Simulating events with 6+ jets and multiple interaction vertices in MADGRAPH
- Automating systematics plots for large collections of xAODs/ROOT NTuples/other analysis objects

## I've got my eyes on:
- Advances in interpretable machine learning and cracking the "black box" problem
- Improving architectures/interfaces for existing physics tools (looking at you, ROOT)

## I want to know more about:
Parallel computing, using Numba/JAX in ML contexts, developing more advanced neural nets (especially GNNs), best practices in scripting/automation for large datasets
