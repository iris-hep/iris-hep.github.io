## My research:
I currently work on ATLAS where I have worked on anomalous jet tagging for di-boson and dark jet searches. I have also worked extensively on the ATLAS upgrade for the readout system of the LAr calorimeter. As of late, I've been interested in applying ML to low-level calorimeter data for long-lived particle searches.

## My expertise is:
Python, C++, ROOT, and ML

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Optimizing software to perform analysis on LAr pulse data

## I've got my eyes on:
Columnar analysis tools, applications of machine learning to particle physics

## I want to know more about:
Machine learning, parallel programming, GPU acceleration, best practices for code maintenance
