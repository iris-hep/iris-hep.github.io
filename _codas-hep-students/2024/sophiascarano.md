## My research:
SUSY (theory); HHbbWW searches (experimental)

## My expertise is:
Python; ML algorithm development; quantum computing simulation

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Efficiently using ROOT and other HEP software resources. Also, transitioning from quantum information science research to HEP research.

## I've got my eyes on:
Model agnostic anomaly detection for LHC data (experimental); quantum error correction in AdS/CFT (theory)

## I want to know more about:
Parallel computing
