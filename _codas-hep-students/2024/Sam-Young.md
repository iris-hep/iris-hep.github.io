## My research:
neutrino physics, differentiable surrogate modeling of photon transport in DUNE ND-LAr/ICARUS and some other deep learning stuff.

## My expertise is:
- python, some C++, root, and a little cuda.
- ai/ml
- making irriversible decisions

## A problem I'm grappling with:
- data parallelism

## I've got my eyes on:
- heterogeneous computing, simulation-based inference methods, and foundation models for physics.

## I want to know more about:
- parallel computing
- best practices for dealing with large datasets
- best practices for developing software like an engineer and not a physicist
