## My research:
Neutrino physics on DUNE/MINERvA.  Developing training, documentation and tools to distribute data from DUNE worldwide and, in future, to make data public.

## My expertise is:
Large scale data movement and production for experiments. Precision electroweak physics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Training large numbers of people in common software.

## I've got my eyes on:
Using HDF5 and data frames for analysis.

## I want to know more about:
How LHC experiments do analysis and documentation.
