## My research:
I am an active member of the CMS collaboration, where I have contributed to the L1Trigger group by deriving the Layer1 calibrations , which are currently being used for data taking in Run 3.  Additionally, I was a member of the MonoJet Run 2 analysis team which searched for extra spacetime dimensions, dark matter, axions, invisible Higgs decays and Leptoquarks. I am now focused on leveraging Machine Learning techniques to search for a rare dark matter signal.

## My expertise is:
Making sense of messy real-world data

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Making my analysis code run faster

## I've got my eyes on:
Muon collider and getting my current CMS analysis approved

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming and using GPUs for faster workflows.
