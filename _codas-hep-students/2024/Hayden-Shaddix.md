## My research:
I'm currently working on creating firmware using HLS for strip clustering ITk input. This project as well as the rest of the tracking pipeline is to be run on FPGAs, but I am working exclusively on the strip clustering kernel.

## My expertise is:
Probably eating or something

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Converting the working HLS into a mounted kernel that interacts with others in the tracking pipeline.

## I've got my eyes on:
Analysis work, particularly Higgs analysis since I spent some time on a simulation analysis for the 2HDM in undergrad.

## I want to know more about:
Hardware and circuits
