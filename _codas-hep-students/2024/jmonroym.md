## My research:
I work on the CMS Silicon Pixel Detector Phase II upgrade. At Cornell University, we serve as the integration site of the project, which means that we get the multiple components of the Forward Pixel Detector and we put them together. We also work on the design and construction of the mechanical structure supporting the Silicon detector modules (DEE), services and cooling among others. I am in charge of the construction and population of the DEE. I am also in charge of the modules testing performed before the detector assembly.

## My expertise is:
In my role, I have accumulated experience in assembly and testing of silicon modules, design of mechanical structures, development of robotic solutions to perform highly precise routines, and thermal performance evaluation.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Currently, I am developing a routine to install the silicon modules on the mechanical structure that support them. Since this process requires high precision, it is performed using a robotic gantry. The big challenge is to connect the modules to the power source without damaging the thermal interface material in between the module and the support structure. This has to be repeated about 2000 times with precision at the level of a 5 microns in alignment and positioning, then the use of robotic aid is mandatory.

## I've got my eyes on:
I have been away from analysis for a while so I am committed to come back and be good at it, meaning, being able to use the latest tools in data analysis.

## I want to know more about:
Machine Learning and artificial intelligence applied to data analysis.
