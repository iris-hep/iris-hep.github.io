## My research:
Searching for heavy resonances decaying to dibosons AND working on the assembly of the HGCAL for CMS

Complaining about the office coffee and solving problems in the lab. But I also know some root, c++ and a touch of python.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Creating new samples for my analysis. 

## I've got my eyes on:
Finally being done with classes!

## I want to know more about:
MC generators
