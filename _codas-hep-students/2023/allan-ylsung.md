## My research:
Dark matter direct detection with a dual-phase argon time projection chamber (TPC) in the DarkSide experiment.

## My expertise is:
Data analysis and instrumentation.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
The optimal deconvolution and pulse-finding algorithms for photoelectron signals in digitized waveforms.

## I've got my eyes on:
Applying machine learning techniques to event reconstruction and classification for dual-phase TPCs.

## I want to know more about:
Machine learning techniques and their applications. Better coding practices.
