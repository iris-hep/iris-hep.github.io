## My research:
I have searched Supersymmetric top quarks and Lepton Flavor Universality violation process, with the ATLAS detector. Currently, I am searching a physics process that could break the lorentz symmetry.

## My expertise is:
Collider physics and statistics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
HEP software

## I've got my eyes on:
Solve physics problem with Machine learning. Quantum computing.

## I want to know more about:
Non-collider experiments and quantum computing.
