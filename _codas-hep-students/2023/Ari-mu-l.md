## My research:
Search for vector-like quarks in the CMS experiment

## My expertise is:
Machine learning

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Getting more comfortable with using HEP analysis tools.

## I've got my eyes on:
Combining what I have been learning about the CMS experiment and my past knowledge on machine learning and optimization to get inspirations for improving my current analysis

## I want to know more about:
Parallel computing and how other people in the HEP community do machine learning
