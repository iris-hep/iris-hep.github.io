## My research:
Search for dimuon production in MicroBoone Liquid Argon Detector.

## My expertise is:
Data Analysis, root, Latex.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Production of a MC sample of 10K events for a dimuon signal in MicroBoone using Genie and LArSoft.

## I've got my eyes on:
MC Generators, LArSoft, BDTs and Liquid Argon detectors.

## I want to know more about:
How to run LArSoft in Grids (Fermilab grid for example) in order to reduce production times of samples.
