## My research:
Implementing Anomaly Detection Machine Learning in the CMS L1 Trigger

## My expertise is:
I'm still and undergraduate so mostly I do minor comparative algorithms.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Learning how to use CMMSW interface and collections for my analyzers.

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning more about innovative software and its applications to complicated physics problems.

## I want to know more about:
Machine Learning, Efficient interfacing between languages, low level computing, proabibility models, monte carlo simulations and a lot more stuff.
