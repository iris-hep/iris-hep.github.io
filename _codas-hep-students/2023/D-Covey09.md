## My research:
Using the NOvA Far Detector to search for extremely massive, highly ionizing particles: a candidate for a magnetic monopole.

## My expertise is:
Primarily C++ and Python. I've been working with the standard physics data "management" tool ROOT for years and understand as little about it as the next guy.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Retrieving real and simulated data from NOvA's ART framework to do my analysis.

## I've got my eyes on:
More generalized data analysis tools than ROOT in preparation for entering the private sector.

## I want to know more about:
Optimization in videogames. It's a bit out of left field, but a game as complex as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom running on hardware effectively as powerful as a high-end smartphone fascinates me. Especially with it's robust interactive kinematic physics systems.
