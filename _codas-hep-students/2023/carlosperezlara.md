## My research:
I am working in detector development nowadays. Specifically in timing detectors, like BTL to be used in CMS upgrade project.

## My expertise is:
I am proficient in data analysis, computer simulation and hardware development for nuclear and particle physics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Finding a detector solution that is 1) fast, 2) can withstand aging in highly radiation environments, and 3) afordable.

## I've got my eyes on:
Learn new developments in technology and new echniques for science compunication.

## I want to know more about:
keep up with the rapid developing and cool computing techniques in order to tackle the new challenges in calculating and measuring.
