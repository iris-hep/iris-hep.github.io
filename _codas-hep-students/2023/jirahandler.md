## My research:
Large Radius Tracking as applied to Long Lived Particle scenarios and  quantifying b-tagging systematic uncertainties in the SUSY RPV/RPC Long Lived analysis in the CERN ATLAS Experiment.

## My expertise is:
Digging deep  while debugging.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Given steps of a Physics analysis, how to efficienctly automate producing required plots from root files. That is, learn how to  automate xAOD - DAOD - Analysis Ntuples - Plots of Interest chain.

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning about graph neural networks and how to build neural networks by myself, in general. So far I've only used pre-designed Neural Networks like Deep Sets.

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming and  optimizing algorithms.
