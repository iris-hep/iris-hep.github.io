## My research:
I am currently studying decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of $b$ quarks using the CMS detector. I am also working on developing an
analysis facility at UW-Madison to facilitate large-scale and interactive physics analyses.

## My expertise is:
building data analysis tools in Python.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Integrating technologies like HTCondor, Dask, columnar analysis, and containerization in an accessible and user-friendly way.

## I've got my eyes on:
optimizing my code with parallelization and vectorization.

## I want to know more about:
how to make statistical analyses more computationally efficient and robust.
