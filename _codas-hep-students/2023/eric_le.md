## My research:
I work with the ATLAS collaboration in analysis and tracking. In particular, I am studying the properties of the Higgs, and developing the implementation of the Hough transform algorithm onto FPGAs.
I generally use ROOT, athena, C, and Python to develop these projects.
## My expertise is:
I am supposed to be an expert on the event filter for the Phase II upgrade of the ATLAS detector.
## A problem I'm grappling with:
I struggle to read documentation, especially C. It takes me a long time to understand a library.
## I've got my eyes on:
Learning about FPGAs and GPUs.
## I want to know more about:
I want to know more about how to write good code. I feel like the structure of my code is heavily bloated and hard for others to read.
