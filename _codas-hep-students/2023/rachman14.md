## My research:
I work with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. I am involved in analysis and tracking. More specifically, I am analyzing the properties of the Higgs boson and developing the Hough transform algorithm for the FPGAs involved in tracking. 

## My expertise is:
I am supposed to be an expert in the proposed Event filter for the Phase II upgrade for ATLAS.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I struggle to remember the semicolons in C/C++.

## I've got my eyes on:
I'd also want to learn emacs.

## I want to know more about:
I want to know more about good coding techniques. I feel like the structure of my code may be unreadable for others.
