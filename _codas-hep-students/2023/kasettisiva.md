## My research:
My previous work includes numu/numubar disappearance at T2K, T2K-NOvA joint oscillation analysis, pion-Ar inclusive cross-section measurement at protoDUNE.

## My expertise is:
Programming experience with C++, Python and the basic tools for HEP like ROOT, shell scripting.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I am currently trying to understand how to leverage machine learning, parallel programming, data science in HEP analysis.

## I've got my eyes on:
Refining my coding skills, learn parallelizing workloads, machine learning.

## I want to know more about:
I am excited to learn techniques on parallelizing workloads, learning more about AI, machine learning.
