## My research:
I am working on leveraging AI in particle accelerators to enhance their performance, optimize beam parameters, and improve beam quality.

## My expertise is:
Accelerator Physics and Data Science

## A problem I'm grappling with:
As we strive to leverage AI techniques for optimizing the accelerator's performance and beam parameters, we encounter occasional instances where certain devices get tripped or suffer damage. This issue arises during real-time adjustments made by AI algorithms.

## I've got my eyes on:
Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Process and Deep Reinforcement Learning

## I want to know more about:
I am eager to delve deeper into the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and parallel programming.
