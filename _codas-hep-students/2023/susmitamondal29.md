## My research:
I am working on analysis of vector boson polarization by looking at polarization in Z bosons in the ZZ to 4l channel using CMS data

## My expertise is:
C++ and ROOT

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Optimizing an existing analysis framework to make it suitable for my analysis

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning how to use DNN in my analysis

## I want to know more about:
ML uses in HEP
