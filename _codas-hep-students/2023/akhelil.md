## My research:
I'm going into my second year of grad school at UMass, Amherst. I'm beginning work in the ATLAS group at UMass, learning about how older computing tools are being updated for use in modern high-energy physics, particularly in preparation for the unprecedented scale of data expected from LHC Run 3.

## My expertise is:
I have experience in condensed matter experiment, particularly neutron scattering, from my first two and a half years of undergrad. The majority of my computational physics experience comes by way of astrophysics. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the impact of active galactic nuclei on adjacent star-forming regions in nearby SDSS galaxies.

## I want to know more about:
I'm most interested in how computational tools, whether hardware or software, can rise up to meet the demand that experiment creates for time-efficient analysis and characterization.
