## My research:
My research work includes investigating the feasibility of porting components of the E/Gamma reconstruction code from cmssw to run on GPUs and an analysis project focused on searches for boosted Higgs decaying to four boosted taus.

## My expertise is:
I have some experience working in C++ and python.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Learning to use Coffea for physics analyses.

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning the columnar object framework and its applications in HEP.

## I want to know more about:
Machine learning techniques that can be applied to physics analyses.
