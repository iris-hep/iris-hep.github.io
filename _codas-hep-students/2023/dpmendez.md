## My research:
Neutrino oscillations:
- Past: long baseline (NOvA, DUNE)
- Present: short baseline, steriles (ICARUS, SBND)

## My expertise is:
Selection optimisation, data analysis, model fitting

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Improve ICARUS neutrino event selection efficiency with neural networks.

## I've got my eyes on:
Graph neural networks.

## I want to know more about:
Big data, paralization.
