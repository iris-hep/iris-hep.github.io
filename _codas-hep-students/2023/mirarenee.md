## My research:
I'm working on commissioning efforts for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

## My expertise is:
I have previously worked on galaxy morphology and Fast Radio Burst (FRB) projects.
A lot of my work involves working with pixel-level images.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I'm working on getting acquainted with the code repositories for the observatory.

## I've got my eyes on:
The new NANOGrav data showing support for background gravitational waves.

## I want to know more about:
How to program like a programmer instead of like a physicist.
