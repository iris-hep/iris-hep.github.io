## My research:
We are currently searching for the Higgs to charm quark decay in the ZH associated production channel, where we require that Z decays to bottom quarks. The search is being done using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at CERN.

## My expertise is:
I've been programming with C++ and Python for over a decade, so I'm quite used to being able to write basic programs to do what I need.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
My practical use with AI and machine learning is currently limited, since I've never gotten many chances to implement it myself.

## I've got my eyes on:
I really enjoy programming, so any challenges that are ahead in this CoDaS school, I'm looking forward to.

## I want to know more about:
I want to learn more about machine learning and techniques for speeding up my programs, whether it be through parallel processing or convenient tricks.
