### My research: 
    - Long-lived particle searches at CMS
    - Portable GPU programming

### My expertise is: 
    - A little bit of coffea, CUDA, Alpaka, Kokkos, SYCL, std::par

### A problem I'm grappling with: 
    - Migrate GPU code written in CUDA into performance and portable code using Alpaka 

### I've got my eyes on: 
    - Portable GPU programming
    - Columnar analysis in HEP
    - Analysis Facilities 

### I want to know more about:
    - Parallel computing
    - How GPUs are used in HEP for HL-LHC computing challenges
    - HEP computing people :)
