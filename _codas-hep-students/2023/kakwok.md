### My research:
    - Long-lived particle searches at CMS
    - Portable GPU programming

### My expertise is:
    - A little bit of coffea, CUDA, Alpaka, Kokkos, SYCL, std::par
    - LLP searches
    - Boosted Higgs physics

### A problem I'm grappling with:
    - Migrate GPU code written in CUDA into performance and portable code using Alpaka

### I've got my eyes on:
    - Portable GPU programming
    - Columnar analysis in HEP
    - Analysis Facilities

### I want to know more about:
    - Parallel computing
    - How GPUs are used in HEP for HL-LHC computing challenges
    - HEP computing people :)
