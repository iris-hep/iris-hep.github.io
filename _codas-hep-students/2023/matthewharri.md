## My research:
I work on a standard model VH physics analysis, more precisely WH(WW) with a three lepton final state.

## My expertise is:
I have previously worked on ACTS (A Common Tracking Software) developing a prototype navigation model for the ATLAS muon spectrometer that could be used for HL-LHC.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Optimizing a multiclass neural network.

## I've got my eyes on:
Learning how to write code that can be used in parallel programming.

## I want to know more about:
Parallel programming.
