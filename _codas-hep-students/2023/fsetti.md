## My research:
di-Higgs pair production in final states with photons and tau leptons.

## My expertise is:
Take any random piece of code and make it run, somehow.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Bureaucracy of the CMS publication process, along with the non-sense requests from the review committee.

## I've got my eyes on:
Refining my C++ skills and apply them outside of HEP.

## I want to know more about:
GPUs and low latency systems, along with best practices for optimised C++ coding.
