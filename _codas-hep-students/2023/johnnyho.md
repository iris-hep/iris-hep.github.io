## My research:
detector research and development to enhance the low-energy detection limits of neutrino experiments and rare-event searches

## My expertise is:
facetiming with my sister's cat

## A problem I'm grappling with:
why are the tools in my lab always in a different spot from where i last left them?

## I've got my eyes on:
the feasibility of detecting solar neutrinos in noble element-based time projection chambers

## I want to know more about:
surrogate models for detector simulations and machine learning-based optimization for detector design
