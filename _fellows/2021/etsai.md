project_goal: >
  Reconstructing particle trajectories, or tracking, in the CMS detector is a crucial
  but slow step in understanding particle collisions at the LHC. Faster tracking methods
  are required to keep up with the significantly increased collision rate in the future
  High-Luminosity LHC. This project focuses on creating an OpenCL based implementation
  of a graph neural network (GNN) completely on an FPGA, rather than the current implementation
  of the GNN on CPU and FPGA coprocessors, with the goal of speeding up tracking.
