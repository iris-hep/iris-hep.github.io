- project_title: Accelerating Uproot with AwkwardForth
  project_goal: >
    Uproot is a Python library made for ROOT I/O. Uproot can only read columnar data
    quickly. The record-oriented layouts are hundreds of times slower, hence, in this
    project we aim to accelerate Uproot using AwkwardForth, a Domain Specific Language.
    This fellowship will involve writing up a meta-programming solution to generate
    schema-specific AwkwardForth code to read ROOT files. This project will result
    in a fully functional ROOT format reader that can replace the current solution
    and also outperform it.
