project_title: Analyzing Neutrino Interactions
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  When neutrinos interact with each other, the result is close to a pixelated image.
  Once the image comes through it can be broken down and analyzed, and then put back
  together. This project will develop an algorithm to help analyze these images using
  simulated events from the DUNE experiment.
