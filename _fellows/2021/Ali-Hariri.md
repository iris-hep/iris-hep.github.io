project_title: Graph Generative Models For Fast Detector Simulations in Particle Physics
focus-area: ia
project_goal: "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the world\u2019s highest\
  \ energy particle accelerator, delivering the highest energy proton-proton collisions\
  \ ever recorded in the laboratory, permitting a detailed exploration of elementary\
  \ particle physics at the energy frontier. Simulating the particle showers and interactions\
  \ in the LHC detectors is both time consuming and computationally expensive. Present\
  \ fast simulation approaches based on non-parametric techniques can improve the\
  \ speed of the full simulation chain but suffer from lower levels of fidelity. For\
  \ this reason, alternative methods based on machine learning can provide faster\
  \ solutions, while maintaining a high level of fidelity. The main goal of a fast\
  \ simulator is to map the events from the generation level directly to the reconstruction\
  \ level. The recent rise of deep generative models paved the way for novel AI-based\
  \ simulation methods. These are characterized by a high ability to learn complex\
  \ data features in a high dimensional space as probability distributions to reconstruct\
  \ or simulate new samples from those data. Hence, generative models make great candidates\
  \ for the representation learning of particle collision events. The most used generative\
  \ architectures are Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Auto-Encoders\
  \ . Given the non-Euclidean nature of jet events data, we aim to investigatethe\
  \ efficiency of graph generative models in simulating event reconstructions in a\
  \ given detector.\n"
