project_goal: "The Large Hadron Collider beauty detector (LHCb) aims to answer the\
  \ question \u201CWhy is matter more prevalent than anti-matter in the         observable\
  \ Universe\u201D by studying beauty/bottom quarks (b-quarks) and their anti-matter\
  \ counterpart (b anti-quarks) which were abundant at the time after Big-Bang. The\
  \ LHCb detector is expected to produce 4Tb/sec of data when it starts running in\
  \ 2021 after the LS2 maintenance is completed. This calls for efficient track and\
  \ primary vertex (PV) reconstruction algorithms to analyze data effectively within\
  \ a practical time frame using relatively low powered computers. This project aims\
  \ to develop a python workflow to test the viability of matrix factorization for\
  \ PV identification, specifically Matrix tri-factorization with orthogonality constraints.\n"
