project_title: Adapting GNN Tracking for FPGAs with hls4ml
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promise for pattern recognition problems
  like particle tracking. To meet the demands of the planned HL-LHC, there has been
  increased interest in accelerating large machine learning (ML) models with FPGA
  coprocessors for integration into the L1 trigger. Deployment of neural networks
  on FPGAs has been studied with the hls4ml compiler package which uses high-level
  synthesis to convert ML models to FPGA firmware. This project proposes to expand
  the hls4ml toolkit to support GNNs for particle tracking, allowing them to be implemented
  in FPGA coprocessor applications possibly including the L1 trigger.
