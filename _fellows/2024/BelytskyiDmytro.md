projects:
-project_title: Usage of CUDA for improving HLT performance
  project_goal: > 
    "develop unsupervised ML algorithm for anomaly vertex search in the view\
    \ of possible implementation at HLT1 depending on the required GPU resources for such\
    \ anomaly search\n"
  mentors:
  - Andrii Usachov

-project_title: CMS Level 1 trigger scouting for luminosity measurement
  project_goal: >
    "The goal of the project is to evaluate the feasibility and precision\
     \ of using 40 MHz Level-1 trigger scouting data for luminosity\
     \ measurements in the CMS experiment by analyzing correlations\
     \ between various trigger primitives\n"
