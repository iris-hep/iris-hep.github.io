projects:
  - project_title: Usage of CUDA for improving HLT performance
    project_goal: >
      Develop an unsupervised ML algorithm for anomaly vertex search in the view
      of possible implementation at HLT1 depending on the required GPU resources for such
      anomaly search.
    mentors:
      - Andrii Usachov
    proposal: /assets/pdf/fellows-2024/UKR039-proposal-Dmytro-Belytskyi.pdf

  - project_title: CMS Level 1 trigger scouting for luminosity measurement
    project_goal: >
      The goal of the project is to evaluate the feasibility and precision
      of using 40â€¯MHz Level-1 trigger scouting data for luminosity
      measurements in the CMS experiment by analyzing correlations
      between various trigger primitives.
