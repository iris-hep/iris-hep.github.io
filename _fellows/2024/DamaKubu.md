project_title: Data Compression Analysis in the ATLAS Experiment
project_goal: "CERN\u2019s experiments generate huge datasets, and reducing their\
  \ size through compression lowers costs and environmental impact by decreasing storage\
  \ needs and energy consumption. A study will be conducted to assess how lossy compression\
  \ affects online tracking performance estimation, comparing compressed data against\
  \ uncompressed benchmarks.\n"
