project_title: Towards Differentiable Jet Clustering
project_goal: >
  Our research is centered on the differentiation of jet clustering methods, which
  presents a key challenge in existing algorithms like anti-kt and the more recent
  qanti-kt. These conventional approaches yield distinct results, making them non-differentiable
  and creating significant hurdles for optimization through neural networks, especially
  in forward automatic differentiation and backpropagation. Our goals are to address
  this issue by converting discrete and deterministic clustering into a probabilistic
  framework through the use of expectations. We also aim to employ this framework
  in the context of neural networks for initial attempts at jet clustering optimization.
