project_title: Anomaly detection in the CMS L1 Trigger - Investigate the effects of
  circular padding for convolutional neural networks over cyclic data
project_goal: >
  Implementation of circular padding on convolutional neural networks and investigation
  off its potential effects on the performance of CICADA. The models is trained on
  simplified, simulated dataset to gauge the potential impact of such padding techniques
  for the CICADA use case.
