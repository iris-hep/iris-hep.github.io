project_title: A rigorous benchmarking of methods for SARS-CoV-2 lineage detection
  in wastewater.
project_goal: >
  Lately, wastewater monitoring as a technique for viral surveillance has seen a lot
  of success. With the current methods in sequencing and software it allows for monitoring
  population viral prevalence with equal quality to the quality of clinical monitoring.
  We propose to extend these capabilities with monitoring the prevalence of all novel
  and appearing strains. The goal now is to evaluate the ability of the chosen methods
  to detect different abundance lineages from sequencing data of wastewater samples
  by also creating a benchmark for that.
