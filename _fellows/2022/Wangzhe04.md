project_title: Implement improved morphing strategy into MadMiner
project_goal: MadMiner is a Machine Learning-based inference tool that uses simulated
  events that can be re-weighted to describe distributions with different values for
  the physics parameters of interest. Currently, the available morphing technique
  in Madminer requires an inflexible distinct number of default physics parameter
  values (basis points) needed to use (the number varies depending on the physics
  process of interest). Thus, we propose to implement a new approach that relaxes
  the requirement which would allow researchers to pick additional physics parameter
  values as basis points while still being able to reweight to any other position
  in parameter space.
