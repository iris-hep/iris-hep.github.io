project_title: Adapting PV-Finder to the CMS and ATLAS Experiments
project_goal: >
  PV-Finder is a hybrid deep learning algorithm which identifies primary vertices.
  This algorithm was developed for use in conjunction with the LHCb detector in Run
  3 of the LHC, which will experience a luminosity that is 5.5 times that of Run 2.
  In LHCb data, the efficiency of the CNN has inreased from to 90% to past  98% over
  the course of the past few years. The success of PV-Finder motivates its extension
  to both the ATLAS and CMS experiments. This project is concerned with the adaptation
  of the PV-Finder algorithm to ATLAS and CMS. Difference in detector geometry, data
  structure, density of particle tracks, and track resolution between experiments
  generate enough variation to motivate a dedicated project.
