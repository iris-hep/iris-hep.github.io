projects:
- project_title: Integrating ML algorithms for LHC data compression into the ESCAPE
    Virtual Research Environment
  project_goal: >
    Integrate one of the current state-of-the-art ML algorithms designed for LHC data
    compression into the ESCAPE Virtual Research Environment as a part of the European
    Open Science Cloud. The successful results of the project will open the possibility
    of extending the use of this algorithm to other experiments and fields.
  mentors:
  - Caterina Doglioni (University of Manchester)
  proposal: /assets/pdf/fellows-2022/200-proposal-Maxym-Naumchyk.pdf
- project_title: Machine Learning on Network Data for Problem Identification
  project_goal: >
    To provide a more effective method of identifying certain types of network issues
    using machine learning so that such problems can be quickly resolved before they
    impact scientists who rely on these networks.
  mentors:
  - Shawn McKee (University of Michigan)
  - Petya Vasileva (University of Michigan)
  proposal: /assets/pdf/fellows-2023/U001-proposal-Maxym-Naumchyk.pdf
- project_title: Adding new features to the Awkward-Array library
  project_goal: >
    To add new QOL features to the Awkward library and to improve interconnection
    with similar features for ragged arrays, like RaggedTensor in TensorFlow's library
    and NestedTensor in PyTorch.
  mentors:
  - Ianna Osborne (Princeton University)
  - Jim Pivarski (Princeton University)
  proposal: /assets/pdf/fellows-2024/UKR018-proposal-Maxym-Naumchyk.pdf
- project_title: Improving and simplifying the Coffea library
  project_goal: >
    The goal of this project is to make coffea library more compatible with other libraries, such as Awkward, Uproot, Dask-awkward.
    This project will also make it easier to propagate changes in these libraries to coffea.
