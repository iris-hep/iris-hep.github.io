project_title: Reading (and possibly writing) RNTuples in Uproot
project_goal: >
  Uproot]is a Python library that
  reads and writes ROOT files, the file format for nearly all particle physics data.
  RNTuple is a new, fully columnar data format for ROOT, which is intended as the
  eventual replacement for TTree.
  Thanks to its columnar structure, data structures of any complexity can be zero-copy
  converted (apart from decompression) into Awkward Arrays.
  In this project, the successful candidate would develop the interface code in Uproot
  to read RNTuple data into Awkward Arrays. If time permits, the candidate may attempt
  to implement RNTuple-writing and RNTuple reading in sister projects in Julia-lang
  as well.
