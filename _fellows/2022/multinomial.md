projects:
- project_title: Developing an automatic pruning utility for statistical models in
    HistFactory format
  project_goal: "In pyhf, large-scale statistical models employed in HEP experiments\
    \ are constructed using a modular approach to build a parametrized family of complex\
    \ probability density functions from more primitive conceptual building blocks.\
    \ It is often useful to make the model more lightweight in order to speed-up the\
    \ derivation of maximum-likelihood estimates of its parameters. What's already\
    \ available in pyhf is only helpful if one manually decides and specifies exactly\
    \ what blocks to remove ('prune') from the statistical model.\nThe goal of this\
    \ project is to devise, implement, document and integrate into the pyhf library\
    \ framework a tool that will automatically decide how to reduce the statistical\
    \ model in HistFactory format, given its pyhf-specification and some \u2018pruning\u2019\
    \ criteria for the blocks.\n"

- project_title: Developing an automatic differentiation and initial parameters optimisation
    pipeline for the particle shower model
  project_goal: >
    During the HEP-experiment it is always interesting to trace the evolution of particle
    and energy distribution in the detector material, i. e., where the particles initially
    hit the material, what was happening in between and where they were eventually
    absorbed. Such distributions heavily depend on experimental conditions like detector
    geometry.

    The goal of this project is to develop a differentiable simulation and optimization
    pipeline to solve an inverse problem to the one described above. The problem of
    finding the best, in a certain sense, geometry of detector material and optimal
    starting conditions for the experiment, given the target properties of particle
    hits inside a detector.
