- project_title: Data Reduction for the ProtoDUNE Detector Control System
  project_goal: >
    The reconstruction of particle trajectories in a LArTPC critically relies on understanding
    the conditions under which the data was taken such as temperature, purity and
    pressure of the LAr, or the high voltage between the wire planes. One use case
    of this data is to exclude periods of unstable high voltage (from short cuts,
    power cuts, etc. . . ) for further data analysis. Currently, these unstable periods
    are identified as cases where the system resistance is lower than a hand-picked
    value. My project is to create an algorithm which can improve this filtering system
    using an unsupervised Machine Learning approach (e.g. Anomaly Detection).

- project_title: 'Intelligent Caching for the HSF Conditions Database: Investigate
    patterns in conditions database accesses'
  project_goal: >
    Conditions data (voltage, current, temperature, detector calibration, etc.) is
    an important part of all HEP experiments and is required to process event data.
    Access to conditions data is critical to producing the best physics results from
    HEP experiments. The challenges for conditions data access are many, notably the
    requirement to provide simultaneous read access to conditions data for distributed
    computing resources at kHz rates. One way to improve the performance of a Conditions
    Database is to use a cache, but the main problem is that it can only store a limited
    number of queries, so we need to make a smart choice of the records we want to
    store, namely those that are more likely to be queried many time. The goal is
    to identify patterns in database queries that will help develop an intelligent
    caching solution.
