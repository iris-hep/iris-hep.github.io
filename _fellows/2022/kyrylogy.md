projects:
- project_title: Implementation of CI/CD Automation and Orchestration in CMS Monitoring
    Kubernetes Clusters
  project_goal: >
    Lots of cron jobs are running in various environments, writing outputs to different
    storages, which creates a dependency to the older infrastructure, also including
    Spark Analytix Cluster managed by CERN IT and ElasticSearch/EOS/MongoDB to store
    the results. The goal of this project is to ease and secure the adoption process
    of each cron job to the k8s clusters by writing individual test scripts.

- project_title: 'Rucio-S3-compatible access interface for analysis facilities: Add
    S3 compatible access interface to Rucio'
  project_goal: >
    Rucio project currently lacks a more flexible and streamlined data exchange process
    that allows scientists to efficiently share specific data subsets for collaboration
    and analysis purposes. A key aspect of this project is therefore to introduce
    an interface that enables users to directly manage S3 buckets. This enhancement
    would greatly improve the user experience, providing a seamless way to handle
    and manipulate specific pieces of data produced within Rucio for efficient collaboration
    and analysis in a standardized way.
