- project_title: Data Classification with PointNet++ for the Active-Target Time Projection
    Chamber at FRIB
  project_goal: >
    We have an Active-Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) detector, which consists
    of a gas chamber (the detector gas is at the same time the target material), a
    source of magnetic and electric fields, and the pad plane on which particles are
    detected. The task is to extract information from the data that we receive on
    the detector, such as information about energy and angles, as well as the classification
    of events to identify particles, using a model built on the basis of the PointNet
    architecture.

- project_title: Using Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Denoising Tracks from AT-TPC
    Detector
  project_goal: "Preliminary work in Dr. Kuchera\u2019s group investigated using diffusion\
    \ probabilistic models (dpm) as a surrogate simulator for generating point clouds\
    \ from the AT-TPC detector. I propose to continue this idea, but in order to denoise\
    \ and clean charged particle tracks recorded by the AT-TPC detector. We plan to\
    \ model the problem as unpaired, event-to-event domain translation. One domain\
    \ would comprise AT-TPC events generated via simulation; the other would comprise\
    \ events recorded during actual experiments with the detector. We expect the trained\
    \ model to be able to remove noise from tracks.\n"

- project_title: Array-Oriented Python Interface for the Pythia Event Generator
  project_goal: >
    Pythia is a cornerstone C++ package used in particle physics for simulating high-energy
    collisions. Although Pythia's current Python interface is excellent for prototyping
    due to its comprehensive feature set, including bi-directional bindings, it becomes
    inefficient when analyzing large datasets because of its one-event-at-a-time approach.
    This project aims to develop an array-oriented Python interface for Pythia, leveraging
    the Awkward Array library to enhance performance and usability, particularly in
    interactive environments like Jupyter notebooks. By focusing on a streamlined
    feature set optimized for speed, this new interface will facilitate more efficient
    data handling, enabling the usage of Pythia through the Python interface for large-scale
    production-level simulation.
