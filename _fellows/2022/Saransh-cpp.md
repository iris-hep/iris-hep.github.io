project_title: Vector - Constructors, documentation, and benchmarks
project_goal: >
  Vector is a Python library for 2D, 3D, and Lorentz vectors, including arrays of
  vectors, designed to solve common physics problems in a NumPy-like way. Vector currently
  supports pure Python Object, NumPy, Awkward, and Numba-based (Numba-Object, Numba-Awkward)
  backends. </br> </br> The user-facing API of Vector is a bit confusing as it does
  not expose its true API, which are the Python classes. The current API provides
  wrapper functions (named as obj, arr, and awk) to users which are also shown in
  the internal classes' __repr__ methods, making these constructor functions even
  more ambiguous. </br> </br> Additionally, the vector library lacks proper user as
  well as API documentation. Currently, there are no detailed explanations in the
  existing tutorials, and most of the functions and classes do not contain docstrings,
  which automatically render when displayed on the documentation website. Furthermore,
  benchmarking would be a valuable addition to the Vector project, which could then
  be propagated to all Scikit-HEP packages in the future. </br> </br> This project
  would aim to prepare Vector for its first major release by exposing its internal
  API to the users, improving the documentation, and adding benchmarks.
