project_title: Efficient implementation of algorithms to reconstruct charged particles
  trajectories
project_goal: "Kalman filter based algorithms are used for many applications in the\
  \ track reconstruction process primarily for its noise reduction properties. This\
  \ project will investigate the possibility of creating a machine learning algorithm\
  \ that embeds the properties of a Kalman filter. We will explore various neural\
  \ network architectures to test their efficacy in the context of current algorithms.\
  \ Achieving higher performance through machine learning based Kalman filters would\
  \ contribute to tracking software\u2019s capability to handle expected increases\
  \ in data flow for high energy experiments.\n"
