project_title: Accelerating Awkward Array Builders
project_goal: >
  Awkward Array is a popular library for nested, variable-sized data, including arbitrary-length
  lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, to manipulate JSON-like data using
  NumPy-like idioms. This project concentrates on improving the performance of the
  builders of Awkward Arrays by exploiting different techniques including Just-in-time
  compilation (JIT) to improve the performance of interpreted programs. Run-time generation
  enables detailed specialization for higher performance, lazy loading for reduced
  memory use in large scale projects. The tasks include making the LayoutBuilder take
  advantage of a JIT compiler to become as fast as specialised output and to optimise
  GrowableBuffer and Forth's OutputBuffers. This project will prove to be useful in
  preventing memory leaks, optimised allocation of memory and providing a significant
  gain in speeds.
