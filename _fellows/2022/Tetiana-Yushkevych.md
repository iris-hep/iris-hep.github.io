project_title: Tools for understanding semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering measurements
project_goal: "Measurements of semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) o\uFB00\
  er a tremendous opportunity to learn about the partonic structure of nucleons. For\
  \ a correct phenomenological interpretation of the information they encode, it is\
  \ vital to develop tools that allow experimental data to be connected to the corresponding\
  \ theoretical framework. Factorization theorems only apply under speci\uFB01c kinematic\
  \ conditions, essentially dictated by power counting. It is therefore very important\
  \ to be able to identify as precisely as possible the sensitivity of each data subset\
  \ to those kinematic requirements.\n"
