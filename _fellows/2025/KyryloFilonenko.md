project_title: "Tagging low momentum taus in CMS"
project_goal: >
    The goal of this project is to develop a dedicated tau reconstruction (tagging) algo-rithm for the CMS Run 3 dataset. This will be based on and extend the low-momentum 3-prong tau tagger developed for CMS Run 2, utilizing the ABCNet model â€” a graph neural network enhanced with attention mechanisms for improved performance.
