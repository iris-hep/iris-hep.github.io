project_title: Beam-Induced Background Simulations at Muon Colliders
project_goal: >
   The project aims to improve the accuracy of Beam-Induced Background (BIB) simulations at muon colliders by tracking parent muon information and grouping decay products accordingly, preserving essential correlations and asymmetries. It will develop a generative neural network to model and synthetically reproduce high-dimensional BIB events, enabling more reliable background estimates for detector design and physics studies.
