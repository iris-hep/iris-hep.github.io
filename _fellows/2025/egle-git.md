project_title: Adapting the Coffea Framework for FCC
project_goal: >
    The goal of this project is to adapt the Coffea analysis framework for effective use with Future Circular Collider (FCC) simulation data. This includes ensuring compatibility with the FCC software ecosystem (Key4hep and FCCSW), developing example analysis workflows based on FCC data, and implementing new algorithmic components such as particle identification and jet-finding strategies. This work aims to contribute to the preparation of a robust, efficient, and scalable data analysis infrastructure ahead of the FCC’s operational phase, enabling streamlined and reproducible workflows for next-generation high energy physics research.
