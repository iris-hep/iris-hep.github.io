projects:
  - project_title: "The usage of Deep Learning for QCD background estimation"
    project_goal: >
      The focus of the present project is to find optimal deep learning models to
      be used for the separation of signal and background events.
    mentors:
      - "Ece Asilar (CERN)"
    proposal: "/assets/pdf/fellows-2022/211-proposal-Andrii-Len.pdf"
  - project_title: "Predict CMS data popularity to improve its availability for physics analysis"
    project_goal: >
      The focus of the project is to aggregate and extract data usage information,
      find dataâ€™s features and optimal Machine Learning models to predict the
      probability that a dataset will be accessed in the next month.
    mentors:
      - "Dmytro Kovalskyi"
      - "Rahul Chauhan"
      - "Hasan Ozturk"
    proposal: "/assets/pdf/fellows-2023/U009-proposal-Andrii-Len.pdf"
  - project_title: "Topological Rare Hadron Decay Tagging with DNN: Deep neural net topological tagger for rare hadron decay identification"
    project_goal: >
      One of the main challenges of this project will be to identify and build an
      effective DNN architecture to train a new model that will not only match BDT
      in performance but gives a significant improvement to the analysis sensitivity.

  - project_title: "Mitigating the Impact of Simulation Mis-Modeling on DNN Training: Building Robust DNNs in the Presence of Detector Mis-Modeling"
    project_goal: >
      In this project, we will compare two methods to mitigate Simulation Mis-modeling
      impact on training: First one is to exclude simulated data completely (use only
      real data for training) and the second one is to modify loss function to include
      penalty terms for mis-modeling. We will assess relative performance and identify
      common trends of these approaches to find an optimal solution.
