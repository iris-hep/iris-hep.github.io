project_title: Machine-Learning Pile-Up-Suppression Trigger Algorithms for the HL-LHC
project_goal: >
    The project aims to develop fast, machine learning-based trigger algorithms to suppress hard-QCD pileup at the HL-LHC, focusing on multi-jet events. It aims to enhance the discrimination between single- and multi-vertex events using lightweight neural networks and/or BDTs that are compatible with FPGA trigger hardware.
