project_title: Backend update of the AlCaVal framework for validation of calibration and alignment conditions
project_goal: >
    The alignment and calibration parameters of the CMS detector, also known as "conditions," are crucial for data quality and are stored in a database for online data acquisition and offline event reconstruction. These conditions continuously evolve due to factors such as faulty readout channels, detector aging, increased noise, and variations in sub-detector support systems (e.g., gas pressure, voltage, magnetic fields, and currents). Consequently, frequent updates and recalibration are necessary to ensure the recorded data accurately reflects real-life conditions. Updated conditions must be validated before being appended to the database, along with their interval of validity. The AlCaVal framework is vital for this validation task in the CMS experiment. While the current validation pipeline is functional, its speed can be improved, a need that will become more critical with the increased intensity of the LHC beams requiring a faster turnaround. Additionally, detailed performance monitoring is currently lacking.
