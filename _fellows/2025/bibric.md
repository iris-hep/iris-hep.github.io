project_goal: >
    For High-Lumi LHC in the CMS experiment the standalone luminometer FBCM is being designed. It is a silicon pad-based detector with dedicated fast ASIC. Various parts of the detector are at the final design stage and will be produced in 2025. To keeping track of the produced components, test results, and overall progress of the detector construction the database is under development.
