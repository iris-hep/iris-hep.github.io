project_title: "Unified Constraints on LLP/FIP Models: Collider-Cosmology Synergy"
project_goal: >
    The project consists of calculating or exploiting already existing constraints from experimental collider and cosmological data, and carefully combining these results into a unified picture that shows allowed regions for dark matter. We want to integrate collider data (ATLAS/CMS mono-X searches, LHCb displaced vertex results) with cosmological constraints (Planck relic density, CMB distortions). Using Bayesian inference methods (e.g., MCMC), we will construct posterior distributions for key parameters (mχmχ, gDgD). Deliverables include combined exclusion plots that highlight regions of parameter space accessible to both colliders and cosmology.
