## My research:
I study the cosmic ray background and deadtime in the Mu2e experiment in simulation, am beginning to contribute to the firmware for the Cosmic Ray Veto (CRV), have participated in the electronics installation and testing of the Mu2e Tracker, and contribute to a NOvA analysis for Light Dark Matter. 

## My expertise is:
C++, C, ROOT. 

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I like to try and think about ways algorithms can be used to reduce backgrounds in my experiment and allow us to be more sensitive to our signal. 

## I've got my eyes on:
I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can from this workshop and being able to apply those skills to my LDM analysis. 

## I want to know more about:
I want to continue to learn more about and look for evidence of Charged Lepton Flavor Violation.
