project_title: "Alpaka Benchmarks for CMS Pixel Track Reconstruction"
project_goal: >
  This project aims to create a suite of performance benchmarks for the Alpaka library to evaluate parallel programming constructs used in the CMS Pixeltrack reconstruction software. It will include simple C++ benchmarks for memory operations, arithmetic, and random number generation, followed by an implementation of the miniBUDE benchmark. The work will help detect regressions early and support long-term performance portability across CPU and GPU platforms.
