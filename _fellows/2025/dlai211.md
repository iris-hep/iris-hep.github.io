project_title: "Validating Fast Analytical Tools Against the ACTS Framework"
project_goal: >
    This project aims to validate a fast analytical tool for estimating detector tracking performance by comparing its results with those from the ACTS framework. By using single-muon simulations and consistent detector configurations, the study will assess the toolâ€™s accuracy in predicting key metrics like momentum resolution. The goal is to demonstrate that the analytical tool provides reliable, efficient feedback for optimizing detector designs in future Higgs Factories.
