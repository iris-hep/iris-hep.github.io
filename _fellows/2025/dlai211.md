project_title: "Validating Fast Analytical Tools Against the ACTS Framework"
project_goal: >
    This project aims to validate a fast analytical tool for estimating detector tracking performance by comparing its results with those from the ACTS framework. By using single-muon simulations and consistent detector configurations, the study will assess the tool’s accuracy in predicting key metrics like momentum resolution. The goal is to demonstrate that the analytical tool provides reliable, efficient feedback for optimizing detector designs in future Higgs Factories.
