project_title: Estimation of the energy cost and efficiency of the HEP data compression
  ML algorithm (Baler)
project_goal: >
  With the increasing amount of information, the management and preservation of research
  data become memory and energy costly. Fast and cost-efficient software for data
  compression is necessary in order to resolve this problem. This can be achieved
  by Baler - neural compression software, but it is required to have the information
  and understanding of how the software allocates and consumes resource and energy.
  In this project, we will estimate the computational resource and energy consumption
  of the Baler framework.
