project_title: Extending Automatic Differentiation Support in RooFit
project_goal: >
  In terms of minimization time, Roofit offers faster results even with numerical
  differentiation techniques as compared to minimizing a likelihood function that
  is written by hand in C++, due its complex caching logic. Automatic differentiation
  gives an additional speedup and more accuracy and scalability for problems with
  large number of parameters. The purpose of this project will be to firstly use Minuit
  as an optimization algorithm with externally provided gradients, extend support
  to cover HistFactory and other parts of RooFit, and finally to optimize Clad generated
  derivatives and further explore how they can be parallelized (OpenMP or CUDA).
