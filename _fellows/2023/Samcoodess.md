project_title: REANA workflow for Dark Matter Searches
project_goal: >
  <a href="https://reana.io/">REANA</a> is a platform for reproducible data analysis
  workflows that can be run at scale. REANA has been used extensively for running
  containerized workflows of LHC experiments, like ATLAS, and for reinterpretation
  of published analyses. This project would aim to implement a REANA workflow for
  a galaxy rotation-curve fitting analysis (RCFM) to improve replicability and to
  provide a starting point for future work.
