project_title: Improving Performance of Track Reconstruction Algorithms in a Muon
  Collider Detector
project_goal: >
  A muon collider is one of the most promising prospects for the near future of experimental
  high energy physics. Such a collider would push the energy frontier and open up
  possibility for precision measurement studies with a compact and sustainable accelerator
  design. However, the short lifetime of the particles in the beam introduces unprecedented
  tracking challenges in the detector design, as the decay products create a Beam
  Induced Background (BIB). This project will work to improve the performance of the
  track reconstruction algorithms used to filter tracks in a muon collider detector
  system. The project will involve a systematic study of the performance of current
  tracking algorithms and the creation of a set of benchmark requirements for the
  algorithms. Additionally, the project may involve porting the tracking algorithms
  to a software stack that takes advantage of multi-threading capacity and would greatly
  increase the computational efficiency of the simulations.
