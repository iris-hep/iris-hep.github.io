"End-user physics analysis", starting from centrally provided files and ending with a published paper, is a field with a diverse set of approaches.
Despite often occupying a significant fraction of physicists' time, this last step in the pipeline is generally less well understood in terms of workflow and computational cost than earlier stages.
We propose a workshop in spring 2025 to identify a representative set of physics analyses, described in terms of workflow and computational needs.
The workshop should result in a document summarizing these analyses, alongside an extrapolation of how we expect them to evolve at the HL-LHC.

The main two questions we expect to discuss are the following:

- What are the computational needs of representative end-user physics analyses today, in terms of overall workflow, services used, number of events and total volume of data to process, and computational cost per event?
- Which scenarios should we consider to extrapolate these physics analysesâ€™ needs toward the HL-LHC?

Achieving community consensus will help move many connected areas of software R&D forward.
The document will be an important ingredient for understanding how long physics analysis at the HL-LHC will take; ensuring that it can comfortably fit into the timescale of a PhD is crucial for the future of our field.
It will provide more clarity about the role of analysis facilities and the kinds of services they should make available.
It will allow for quantitative evaluation of analysis models and be a first step towards identifying what to do about analysis use cases that do not fit into the space set out by the benchmark examples.
