The National Science Foundation (NSF) has [launched](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=296456&org=NSF&from=news) the Institute
for Research and Innovation in Software for High-Energy Physics
(IRIS-HEP), a $25 million effort to tackle the unprecedented torrent
of data that will come from the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider
(HL-LHC), the world's most powerful particle accelerator.

IRIS-HEP will address key elements of the
["Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982)
and will implement the ["Strategic Plan for a Scientific Software
Innovation Institute (S2I2) for High Energy Physics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06592)
submitted to the NSF in December 2017.
These two documents represent, respectively, the outcome of international
and U.S. HEP community planning processes; these were driven in part
by the NSF-funded [S2I2-HEP Institute Conceptualization Project](http://s2i2-hep.org).
Over the course of a dozen workshops during 2016 and 2017, more than 260
scientists and engineers from around the world were involved in building this community vision.
