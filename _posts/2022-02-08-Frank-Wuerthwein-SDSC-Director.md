When asked to describe his job, the director of one of the world's
most advanced high-performance computing centers uses a pre-digital
metaphor.

"The key," says Frank Würthwein, director of the San Diego Supercomputer
Center (SDSC), "is being able to play matchmaker."

By that Prof. Würthwein, who assumed the role on Dec. 1 after having
served as interim director since July, refers to SDSC's mission to
link science and cyberinfrastructure (CI) in ways that solve
scientific and societal problems.

"The SDSC's core competency is translating innovation into practice,"
he says. "Combining the elements of cyberinfrastructure – the
experts, the software, our partners – is the key to that translation."

Würthwein sits on the executive board of the [Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP)](https://iris-hep.org/),
a software institute established
in 2018 to meet the Large Hadron Collider's formidable computing
challenges in the coming decades. Funded by a grant from the National
Science Foundation, IRIS-HEP aims to develop tools and techniques
whose impacts can extend beyond high energy physics.

As SDSC director, Würthwein says that one of his primary tasks is
"having your finger at the pulse of the problems that are looking
for solutions."

A prime example, says Würthwein, is [Firemap](https://firemap.sdsc.edu/),
a web-based tool that helps simulate, predict, and visualize the
spread of wildfires. Funded by an NSF  grant awarded to the University
of California San Diego in 2013, Firemap combines data from satellite
imagery, mountaintop camera feeds, and environmental sensors with
weather data and fuel maps into an integrated platform that can
forecast wildfires in real time. The platform also enables fire
managers to model hypothetical scenarios to help them better mitigate
future wildfires.

Building off of this work is BurnPro3D, an AI-powered decision-support
platform that helps public officials better understand the risks
and tradeoffs when conducting prescribed burns, a practice that
helps deprive wildfires of fuel. Funded last year with a $5 million
grant from the [NSF's Convergence Accelerator program](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/convergence-accelerator), the project
unites researchers from SDSC with a diverse group of collaborators,
including researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Tall
Timbers Research Station and Land Conservancy in Florida, the US
Geological Survey, the University of Southern California, the US
Forest Service, and others.

## An eclectic outlet

A central part of the SDSC director’s role is to identify the right
collaborators for the right projects, and Würthwein relishes the
task.

"We work with industry, we work with third parties, we work with
funding agencies, we work with NGOs, we work with various individuals,"
he says. "It's a great pleasure to look at the customer base and
see the diversity."

A particle physicist by training, Würthwein is no stranger to
projects that call for mass coordination. Before taking the helm
of the SDSC and its more than $40 million annual budget, he worked
on the Compact Muon Solenoid at the Large Hadron Collider, an
experiment involving thousands of scientists and engineers from
more than 200 institutions around the world.

Despite his background in a discipline that he describes as "esoteric,"
Würthwein says he has always been drawn to a broad variety of
subjects. "I've always had a hard time drawing lines around physics,"
he says.

Würthwein's multidisciplinary instincts make him well suited for
SDSC, which provides computing resources to projects across a wide
array of disciplines, including high-energy physics, genomics, Earth
sciences, chemistry, and economics.  "My new job description requires
me to talk to a diverse set of people all the time," he says. "I've
turned my eclectic interests into a day job."

The position affords Würthwein with the ideal perch for playing
matchmaker. "In my role I can focus on opportunities for new
collaborations while members of our SDSC community focus on the
many other important functions of our center," he says. “Together,
we identify the problems for which we search for solutions.”

## 'Pi in the CI'

Würthwein can encapsulate SDSC's mission with a single Greek letter.
"The letter π is for us a symbol of what we do," he says.

The letter π's two legs represent the various scientific disciplines
on one side, and cyberinfrastructure on the other. The crossbar on
top represents the work of linking the two legs together.

Since 2014, the SDSC has recognized outstanding examples of this
work with its "π Person of the Year" award. That year, the award
went to Ilkay Altintas, now SDSC'S Chief Data Science Officer. Dr.
Altintas helped create the [Kepler collaboration](https://kepler-project.org/), a scientific
workflow application that allows scientists across a broad range
of disciplines to share and merge datasets, models, software tools,
and other analytical components. Last year's award recognized the
research scientist Subhashini Sivagnanam, who developed a way to
use blockchain technology to establish the provenance and preserve
the integrity of research data.

According to Würthwein, coupling innovation with practice requires
a solid dose of optimism. "The matches are never perfect," he says.
"Invariably it's square holes and round pegs. You have to be willing
to trust in your ability to bring it all together."
