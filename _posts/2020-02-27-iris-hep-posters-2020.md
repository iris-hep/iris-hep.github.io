On Thursday, February 27, 2020, members of IRIS-HEP got together at Princeton University to take stock of our progress in the first 18 months and plan for the future. A poster session was held in conjunction with this review session to highlight the work of members from the first 18 months of IRIS-HEP.

In all, twenty-seven posters were presented by PIs, Postdocs, Students, Fellows, and Staff encompassing topics from all areas of IRIS-HEP.  The topics included general information about IRIS-HEP, operational and policy information,  the development and deployment of services and tools, and the application of novel approaches to computing challenges.

All the posters from the session are available here:
