We are preparing to announce the opening for the [2025 Fellows program](/fellows.html) for student applications.  In the past, our Fellows have completed a good deal of excellent work and research across a wide variety of projects.  We look to continue these efforts.  Prior to the call for new Fellows we are soliciting new ideas for Fellows projects for summer 2025.  You can see a list of projects available here:

<http://research-software-collaborations.org/projects_irishep>

If there is a project that you would like to propose and you are willing to mentor a student (directly or as part of a group), please go to <https://github.com/research-software-collaborations/project_database> and make a pull request to create your particular project(s).

The directions for adding a project can be found in the repository.

We plan to send out the announcement for the Fellows Program shortly, so we would like to have new projects in place as soon as possible.
