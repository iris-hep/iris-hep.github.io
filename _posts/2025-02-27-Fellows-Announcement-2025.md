We are pleased to announce that applications for the IRIS-HEP undergraduate Fellows program in Summer 2025 are now open. Selected IRIS-HEP Fellows will spend several months working with a mentor to build their skills while working on a research software project relevant to the Institute.

**Who should apply to the Fellows program?** - Are you reasonably comfortable with basic programming through skills acquired (for example) from coursework or dedicated training activities? Are you interested in building on those skills to gain experience through contributions to cutting edge open source research software projects? Then the IRIS-HEP Fellows program could be for you. Prior physics knowledge is helpful, but not required. We will also offer dedicated training activities to help you improve specific software skills.

Fellows will receive a training stipend as part of their participation.

This year's program is open to students associated with US universities, students of Ukrainian origin and students from Vilnius University.

Applications submitted before Monday, 10 March, 2025 (end of the day, any time zone) will be prioritized for consideration. The application form will however remain open and applications can nonetheless be submitted through March 24th, 2025.

For more information on the program including how to apply, and links to projects of past Fellows, please see:
