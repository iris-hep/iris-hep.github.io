The very first Machine Learning Hackathon at the Physics Department
of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez took place on 24-26
April, 2019, organized by IRIS-HEP Training, Education and Outreach
coordinator (and UPRM physics professor) [Sudhir Malik](http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/).

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical
model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on
the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and
make decisions with minimal human intervention.  While many machine
learning algorithms have been around for a long time, the ability
to automatically apply complex mathematical calculations to big
data repeatedly and ever faster is a recent development. Learning
these skill would make it possible to quickly and automatically
produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver
faster, more accurate results. The potential for using ML techniques
encompasses all STEM fields. Learning ML tools early on can be
very useful in a number of career paths and thus there is a great demand
for opportunities such as this hackathon.

Diyaselis Delgado López, a UPRM physics undergraduate student who
participated, was surprised and excited about what she learned: "Thanks to
this experience, I definitely want to investigate further and use these
techniques in everything I can." Ricardo González, another physics undergrad
at UPRM, also participated in the Hackathon. He felt that attending the
Hackathon was extremely valuable "because it opened my eyes to a powerful tool
that physicists have within our reach. Soon I will become a graduate student,
and I am now looking for ways to incorporate what I have learned here."

The hackathon [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/809812/timetable/)
included talks by UPRM researchers and faculty from the Mathematics, Physics
and CS&E departments. Topics included covered Statistics, ML
techniques and use cases from research activities at UPRM. [Dr. Sergei
Gleyzer](http://sergeigleyzer.com), a physicist from University of Florida and convener of ML group at
the CMS Experiment at CERN, also participated as a lecturer and facilitator.
The participants were students from UPRM who were given challenging
problem to solve during Hackathon.
