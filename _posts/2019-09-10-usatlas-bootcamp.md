IRIS-HEP/FIRST-HEP partnered with the Software Carpentries and USATLAS for the first USATLAS Bootcamp, held at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This five day training event taught four basic computing skills: version control, build systems, continuous integration/testing, and containers, and then followed up each day with an ATLAS specific lesson over that topic. For the final half-day, instructors proposed a set of topics and the students voted on them; the top three topics were then taught in parallel sessions.

Students had a great time. Several fun activities were planned, such as a pizza lunch, two dinners at a local restaurants, and a visit to the Berkeley Bowl. Insert testimonials here.
