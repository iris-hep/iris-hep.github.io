# IRIS-HEP Fellows Program

**Applications for the Undergraduate Fellow progam in Summer 2022 are now open. The deadline for applications is Tuesday, 8 March, 2022 (end of the day, any time zone).**

  People are the key to successful software. IRIS-HEP aims to promote the development of advanced research software skills by providing opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to connect with mentors within the larger High Energy Physics (HEP) and Computational/Data Science community. At the same time, we aim to promote software as a collaborative activity and encourage collaborations which engage individuals in ways that maximize their potential and their potential impact on the community.

  To accomplish these goals, IRIS-HEP has created a Fellows program. IRIS-HEP
Fellows will spend some number of months working with a mentor to build their skills while working on a research software project relevant to the Institute.


**Who should apply to the Fellows program?** - Are you reasonably comfortable
with basic programming through skills acquired (for example) from coursework or
dedicated training activities? Are you interested in building on those skills to gain experience through contributions to cutting edge open
source research software projects? Then the IRIS-HEP Fellows program could be for you. Prior physics knowledge is helpful, but not required. We will also offer dedicated [training activities](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/training/curriculum.html) to help you improve specifi software skills. *Applications from women and members of underrepresented groups in STEM activities are particularly encouraged.*

<!--
Two types of IRIS-HEP Fellows are possible:
-->

We are currently accepting applications for one category of IRIS-HEP Fellows:

  * **IRIS-HEP Undergraduate Fellows** - Undergraduate fellows work with a mentor to develop research software relevant in one of the R&D areas listed below. Undergraduate fellows will receive a training stipend, paid monthly, during their fellowship. In most cases, they will in general remain in their home location and work in remote with their mentor. - **Applications are now open - deadline 8 March**
  * Eligibility:
    * You must be enrolled in an undergraduate program at an accredited University or College and have completed at least 1 academic year by the start of the Fellowship.
    * Our NSF funding supports student Fellows associated to U.S. universtities and colleges, but we do have separate funding for a small number of international students.

<!--
  * **IRIS-HEP Graduate Fellows** - Masters or Ph.D. Graduate fellows work with a mentor to develop research software relevant for HEP in one of the R&D areas listed below. Graduate fellows will receive subsistence, paid monthly, during their fellowship and their travel to relocate to work in person with the mentor will be provided. They should not in general have support via a teaching or research assistant position during the fellowship period. **Applications opening soon**
-->

**Which R&D areas are relevant for IRIS-HEP?** - We are particularly interested in software R&D areas where IRIS-HEP personnel are active, but may also consider proposals for other software R&D topics of larger relevance to the HEP community. The IRIS-HEP activities include:

  * [Analysis Systems](/as.html)
  * [Innovative Algorithms](/ia.html)
  * [Data Organization, Management and Access](/doma.html)
  * [Scalable Systems](/ssl.html)
  * [Tools and Material to support Training activities](/ssc.html)
  * [Service containerization, DevOps, security, service monitoring, and accounting](/osglhc.html)
  * [Network monitoring and analytics](/osglhc.html)

(Click through the links above to see the specific projects on which we are working.)
It is *not* required that the mentors are IRIS-HEP team members, or that
a specific project be one for which IRIS-HEP personnel are active. Any
appropriate mentor from the larger community working in one of
these areas can be part of the program.




<!--
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, no travel or relocation subsistence costs can currently be paid to support co-location of either Undergraduate or Graduate Fellows with mentors. Fellows will in general work remotely at a distance with their mentors, unless they happen to be at the same institution.

For Summer 2021 we are happy to accept proposals for IRIS-HEP Fellows from undergraduate students and
graduate students that do not have a research assistantship (e.g. Masters students).
Due to COVID-19 restrictions, no travel or relocation subsistence costs can currently be paid to support co-location of either Fellows with mentors. Fellows will in general work remotely at a distance with their mentors, unless they happen to be at the same institution. Applicant students should be associated with a US university.
-->

<!--
**Duration of fellowship and total stipend:** An IRIS-HEP fellowship will pay up to 3 FTE-months (full time equivalent) at $2000/month. As full time research software activities are not consistent with taking classes during the academic year (as opposed to summer), most fellows will work a smaller time fraction over a larger number of calendar months. (For example, half-time for 6 months.) Applicants should include a proposed time profile for their activities in their proposal, as well as note their academic course load and/or any other activities taking significant time.
-->


**Duration of fellowship and total stipend:** An IRIS-HEP fellowship will pay up to 3 FTE-months (full time equivalent) at $2400/month during Summer 2022. We have some flexibility to accommodate different summer schedules and lengths. Most Fellowships should last either 10 or 12 weeks (2.5 or 3 months).


**Projects:** Research software projects should in general be in the R&D areas listed above or (in some cases) be projects of more general interest to the HEP community. How do you find a project? There are several possibilities:

  * Examples of currently open IRIS-HEP Fellow projects can be found **[on a separate webpage](/fellow_projects.html)**. These projects are of interest to IRIS-HEP researchers (who may then act as mentors). You can write to the mentor listed to discuss or reach out to fellows@iris-hep.org for more information. *This page may be updated from time to time, so check back and reload.*
  * Additional example projects of interest in the wider HEP community can also be found on the [HEP Software Foundation Google Summer of Code (HSF GSoC) webpage](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html). While GSoC is a separate program, funded by Google, many of the projects could also be appropriate for IRIS-HEP Fellows if they are related to the R&D areas listed above.
  * Recent Fellows and links to descriptions of their projects can be found below in the list of current and past Fellows. In some cases, there may be continuations of those projects.
  * Some additional projects for Summer 2021 are listed on the [DIANA/HEP Fellows webpage](http://diana-hep.org/pages/fellows.html) and on the open projects page of the [Compiler Research](https://compiler-research.org/open_projects) project
  * You can explore the links above to the IRIS-HEP R&D research activities. Most IRIS-HEP active projects list contacts with whom you can discuss to bring your own ideas.

Prospective fellows are encouraged to **contact specific mentors** listed on the project pages above.
If you have a idea for a project which excites you, but do not find similar examples or are not sure which mentor to contact, please do not hesitate to contact the IRIS-HEP fellows@iris-hep.org mailing list. The lists above are not exhaustive. We will help you link up with possible mentor candidates!

Prospective fellows can apply using this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fb1cxbZ1XoGdV6sDwlDs3kc7dJFY78ohx0IoWBRMdMs/edit). You will need to provide:

 * Your full name, email address, the name of your university or college and your current or planned major and/or area of study
 * A resume/CV (in pdf format) with contact information
 * An academic transcript - this can be unofficial, but should include course titles and overall GPA. At the time the Fellowship starts you must have completed at least 1 year of university/college.
 * A short essay describing your interest in the internship program (maximum 1 page, pdf format). For example, you may wish to expand on 3 or 4 topics from the following list: your background, your skills, and strengths;  what software, computing or scientific topics appeal to you; previous research experience, if any; what you may want to pursue as a future career; and what benefits you would like to gain from this program. If you already have a potential mentor and/or particular projects which interest you from the project lists above, you can also mention them here. It is however not required to have a mentor/project finalised to submit an application. Successful applicants will be connected to mentors to select and define their projects in a 2nd step following this application
 * [Optional] The full name and email address of a reference. This is optional. Ideally it would be someone with whom you have interacted in a STEM context (e.g. a course or a previous research activity). You should contact the person in advance to confirm that they will write a letter for you and simply provide their name/email. After you submit the application form, we will contact them to request the letter.

 
<!--
 * A short proposal.  In the proposal you should briefly describe the software development activity that you would like to pursue, and how that activity will enhance your own and other people's research activities. **Note also the intended software project or person with whom you will collaborate as mentor. Proposals for which an initial plan has been worked out with the mentor will likely rank more strongly.** The proposal should be short, typically no more 1-2 pages to describe the project and then a short timeline with deliverables (see also examples from previous fellows). The timeline should also include the proposed FTE effort fractions by month (not to exceed 3 FTE-months total) and information on other major activities taking significant time (other research activities or jobs, coursework load, etc.)

  * Princeton postdoc Savannah Thais is organizing a session at the APS
    April meeting entitled "Physics Response to COVID-19".

  * Princeton researchers Peter Elmer, Henry Schreiner, David Lange and Jim
    Pivarski are contributing the software for a patient pressure and
    airflow monitoring system for
    ventilators. The system allows up to 20 patients to be monitored remotely
    by a nurse in a COVID-19 field hospital, with relevant alarms. This
    outreach activity is being done in collaboration with
    [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/) and a number of other
    Princeton Physics, Mechanical Engineering and Neuroscience faculty.
    The system includes data analysis algorithms, visualization and data
    acquisition from the sensor system (written in Python). The following image shows the nurse monitoring station GUI with simulated time series data for airflow, lung pressure and tidal volume transferred to the lungs.

  * A number of IRIS-HEP researchers were involved in setting up the
    [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) to make connections
    that enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to understanding
    and combating the global COVID-19 problem and/or its economic and
    societal impacts. This website provides resources and information
    for such researchers. An associated Slack workspace and Zoom
    meetings allow researchers to interact. We have also recently begun
    organizing [talks and discussions](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12245/)
    with non-Physics researchers. Some of these are being recorded and
    made available in a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZvkLnDkqbQ1qIE7PA741dQUb1zw6FBd).
