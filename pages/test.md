  * Princeton postdoc Savannah Thais is organizing a session at the APS
    April meeting entitled "Physics Response to COVID-19".

  * Princeton researchers Peter Elmer, Henry Schreiner, David Lange and Jim
    Pivarski are contributing the software for a patient pressure and
    airflow monitoring system for
    ventilators. The system allows up to 20 patients to be monitored remotely
    by a nurse in a COVID-19 field hospital, with relevant alarms. This
    outreach activity is being done in collaboration with
    [Penn Medicine](https://www.pennmedicine.org/) and a number of other
    Princeton Physics, Mechanical Engineering and Neuroscience faculty.
    The system includes data analysis algorithms, visualization and data
    acquisition from the sensor system (written in Python). The following image shows the nurse monitoring station GUI with simulated time series data for airflow, lung pressure and tidal volume transferred to the lungs.

  * A number of IRIS-HEP researchers were involved in setting up the
    [Science Responds](https://science-responds.org/) to make connections
    that enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to understanding
    and combating the global COVID-19 problem and/or its economic and
    societal impacts. This website provides resources and information
    for such researchers. An associated Slack workspace and Zoom
    meetings allow researchers to interact. We have also recently begun
    organizing [talks and discussions](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12245/)
    with non-Physics researchers. Some of these are being recorded and
    made available in a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZvkLnDkqbQ1qIE7PA741dQUb1zw6FBd).
