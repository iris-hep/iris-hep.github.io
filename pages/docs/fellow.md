### Adding or updating a Fellow Page on the IRIS-HEP Website

**NOTE**: Do not add a new file if you were a fellow before - just make updates to to your existing markdown file. (See "Adding multiple projects" to include your new project)

In order to add your information, we request you to please supply a photo ( First_Name-Last_Name.jpg or .png - 320x240 pixels) and a paragraph summarizing your project’s goals.

You should submit a pull request with the photo, a markdown file with the summary information above, and your proposal to this repo:

<https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io>


* Add a photo named `First-Last.jpg` or `.png` to the [assets/images/team/fellows-2025 folder](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/team/fellows-2025). It should be 320x240 pixels and in general should be 200kB or less.
* If you have been offered and accepted a Fellow position, your proposal will be uploaded by us to the [assets/pdf/follows-2025 folder](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/assets/pdf/fellows-2025). Find the exact filename and use that below.
* Add a "`<your github username>.md`" file to the [fellows folder in the website repository](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/_fellows/2025). See the example below.

*Please Note*:  In the markdown file you create, ensure you set the “active” attribute to True – (i.e.  active: True).  Otherwise, your entry will not appear on our Fellows page.

Be sure to include your project summary in the project_goal field.

You can leave the “presentations” and “current_status” fields blank for now.  (Make sure to include the fields)

You can optionally include your linkedin-profile.

*MAKE SURE YOU INCLUDE THE "---" STRINGS AT THE BEGINNING (above "layout:") AND THE END (elow "linkedin-profile:") OF THE MD FILE (SEE EXAMPLE BELOW)*

*OMIT THE "<" AND ">" CHARACTERS WHEN YOU CREATE YOUR MARKDOWN FILE - I.E. "fellow-name: <Your Name>" becomes "fellow-name: Jane Doe"*

#### Adding multiple projects
If you are a returning fellow and need to add multiple projects, follow the directions found here to update the markdown file for your page:

  <https://iris-hep.org/docs/fellows_multiple_projects>

### Dates
Date format for start and end dates should be -- YYYY-MM-DD -- i.e. 2025-12-31

### Photos
Photos should be 320x240 and should be under 200kB.  Make sure your the file you specify in the "photo:" parameter has the same extension as the file you uploaded (i.e. .jpg, .png, etc)

### Presentations

The meaning of the fields is the following:

  * title - the title of the talk: you made need to place it in double quotes, if certain characters like a colon (":") are included in the title
  * date - the date on which the presentation was made, in the numeric format "YYYY-MM-DD"
  * url - this should be a direct URL to the presentation or page containing the presentation. For Indico, link to the contribution, not the PDF or other links.
  * meeting - the name of the meeting
  * meetingurl - the URL for the meeting in which the presentation was made
  * focus-area - optionally list the relevant focus area for this presentation, using its short name, i.e. one of [ia,ssl,ssc,doma,as,osglhc]. Must be a yaml list if more than one is present.
