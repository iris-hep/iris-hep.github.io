Please complete and attach the appropriate forms with copies of any additional documents as needed and answer the two questions above in an email message to <fellows@iris-hep.org>.

If you have general tax-related questions, please email <finance@princeton.edu>.  For personal tax-related questions, we encourage you to seek the advice of a tax professional.

### IRIS-HEP Web Site <i class="fas fa-link"></i>

Additionally, we also would like to add you to our Fellows webpage:

  <https://iris-hep.org/fellows.html>

Follow the directions found here to create a markdown file for your page:

  <https://iris-hep.org/docs/fellow>

Once your pull request is merged and your fellows page is available on the webpage, you should update the IRIS-HEP project database with this that link. Follow instructions here to do that:

### IRIS-HEP Fellows Slack Channel <i class="fab fa-slack"></i>

Please also join the IRIS-HEP Fellows Slack Channel to interact with other Fellows and Mentors.

We will also use this channel to communicate news items and announce Fellows-relevant events this summer.

[IRIS-HEP Fellows Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/iris-hep/shared_invite/zt-19ml94dae-M2CTO91Nr7noKI0MG5tiaw)

Once you accept the invite you can join the fellows channel in Slack by searching for "**#fellows**", selecting the channel and clicking "**Join Channel**" or by typing:
```
/join #fellows
```
in the message field and sending the message.

In general with communications on the Slack channel, we expect our members to:

* Be welcoming and support people of all backgrounds and identities
* Be considerate in words and actions
* Be respectful

More specifically, the values outlined in our [Code of Conduct](https://iris-hep.org/about/code-of-conduct) applies equally to all community members in all institute situations online and offline.  As IRIS-HEP members, we expect fellows to be stewards of these values as well.
