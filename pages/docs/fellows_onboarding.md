Welcome to IRIS-HEP!  Congratulations on your acceptance into the IRIS-HEP Fellows Program.  We look forward to your contribution and collaboration.

There are some additional items needed to complete the onboarding process.

#### Payment Information

You need to fill out a Payee Management Form in order to receive payment.

#### IRIS-HEP Fellows Slack Channel

We also invite you to join the IRIS-HEP Fellows Slack Channel to interact with other Fellows and Mentors

[IRIS-HEP Fellows Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/iris-hep/shared_invite/zt-19ml94dae-M2CTO91Nr7noKI0MG5tiaw)

In general with communications on the Slack channel, we expect our members to:

* Be welcoming and support people of all backgrounds and identities
* Be considerate in words and actions
* Be respectful

More specifically, the values outlined in our [Code of Conduct](https://iris-hep.org/about/code-of-conduct) applies equally to all community members in all institute situations online and offline.  As IRIS-HEP members, we expect fellows to be stewards of these values as well.
