### Adding or updating a CoDaS-HEP participant page on the IRIS-HEP Website

In order to add your information, we request you to please supply a photo ( First_Name-Last_Name.jpg or .png - 320x240 pixels) and some information about
yourself in the form a markdown file.

Summary: you should submit a pull request with the photo and a markdown file as described below to this repo:

<https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io>

* Add a photo named `First-Last.jpg` or `.png` to the [assets/images/codas-hep/2023/](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/codas-hep/2023/) folder. It should be 320x240 pixels and in general should be 150kB or less.
* Add a "`<your github username>.md`" file to the [CoDaS-HEP 2023 participants folder in the website repository](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/_codas-hep-students/2023/). There is a "example-template.md.txt" in that directory that you copy to to <your github username>.md and edit. See the example below. There are some portions which you can edit to tell us more about yourself. See [examples from CoDaS-HEP 2022](https://codas-hep.org/downloads/CoDaS-HEP-2022-introduction-slides.pdf).

You can optionally include your linkedin-profile and your orcid if you have one.

As part of this you can also specify logs for projects or experiments
you are involved with. (Change the CMS and IRIS-HEP examples above to
those that make sense for you.) An initial set of possible logos
can be found in [the CoDaS-HEP logo area](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/codas-hep/logos). If you need to add
a new one, please aim to keep the filesize under 150kb.
