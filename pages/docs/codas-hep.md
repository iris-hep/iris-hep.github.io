### Adding or updating a CoDaS-HEP participant page on the IRIS-HEP Website

In order to add your information, we request you to please supply a photo ( First_Name-Last_Name.jpg or .png - 320x240 pixels) and some information about
yourself in the form a markdown file.

Summary: you should submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#) with the photo and a markdown file as described below to this repo:

<https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io>

* Add a photo named `First-Last.jpg` or `.png` to the [assets/images/codas-hep/2024/](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/codas-hep/2024/) folder. It should be 320x240 pixels and in general should be 150kB or less.
* Add a "`<your github username>.md`" file to the [CoDaS-HEP 2024 participants folder in the website repository](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/_codas-hep-students/2024/). There is a "example-template.md" in that directory that you copy to to "`<your github username>.md`" and edit. See the example below. There are some portions which you can edit to tell us more about yourself. See examples from CoDaS-HEP 2023 on the [website](https://iris-hep.org/codas-hep-2023.html) and in [github](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/_codas-hep-students/2023/).

You can optionally include your linkedin-profile and your orcid if you have one.

As part of this you can also specify logos for projects or experiments
you are involved with. (Change the CMS and IRIS-HEP examples above to
those that make sense for you!) An initial set of possible logos
can be found in [the CoDaS-HEP logo area](https://github.com/iris-hep/iris-hep.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/codas-hep/logos). Please link to those if appropriate ones already exist for your affiliations. If you need to add a new one, please keep the filesize under 150kb.
