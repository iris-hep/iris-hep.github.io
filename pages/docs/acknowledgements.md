## Acknowledgement of IRIS-HEP support in publications and conference proceedings

It is important that funding support from IRIS-HEP is acknowledged in all
publications and conference proceedings which result from that funding.
The following text should be used:

---

*This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement OAC-1836650.*

---

Suitable variations to also acknowledge other sources of support are of
course acceptable, but the specific award number (OAC-1836650) for IRIS-HEP
must be included.

## Referencing IRIS-HEP in Publications

If you need to reference/cite IRIS-HEP in a Publication (independent from the acknowledgement of funding
support as described above) you have several non-exclusive choices: you can reference the NSF award number
as above (OAC-1836650), you can reference the website and you can reference the Strategic Plan and/or
the Community White Paper that led to IRIS-HEP. BibTex entries for these would be:

```
@Article{S2I2HEPSP,
  author        = "Elmer, Peter and Neubauer, Mark and Sokoloff, Michael D.",
  title         = "{Strategic Plan for a Scientific Software Innovation Institute (S2I2) for High Energy Physics}",

}
```

## Use of arXiv for conference proceedings

When publications intended for inclusion in conference proceedings are
submitted to the conference, they should **also** be submitted as a preprint
to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). Given the typically very long latencies for
official proceedings to appear, publishing a preprint early on the arXiv allows
them to be referenced and read soon after the conference. Subsequent
revisions due (for example) to feedback from referees of the conference
proceedings should **also** be uploaded to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as
new versions of the original submission.
