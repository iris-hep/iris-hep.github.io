## Acknowledgement of IRIS-HEP support in publications and conference proceedings

It is important that funding support from IRIS-HEP is acknowledged in all
publications and conference proceedings which result from that funding.
The following text should be used:

---

*This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement OAC-1836650.*

---

Suitable variations to also acknowledge other sources of support are of
course acceptable, but the specific award number (OAC-1836650) for IRIS-HEP
must be included.

## Use of arXiv for conference proceedings

When publications intended for inclusion in conference proceedings are
submitted to the conference, they should **also** be submitted as a preprint
to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). Given the typically very long latencies for
official proceedings to appear, publishing a preprint early on the arXiv allows
them to be referenced and read soon after the conference. Subsequent
revisions due (for example) to feedback from referees of the conference
proceedings should **also** be uploaded to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as
new versions of the original submission.
