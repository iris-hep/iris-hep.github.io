## Acknowledgement of IRIS-HEP support in publications and conference proceedings

It is important that funding support from IRIS-HEP is acknowledged in all
publications and conference proceedings which result from that funding.
The following text should be used:

---

*This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreements OAC-1836650 and PHY-2323298.*

---

Suitable variations to also acknowledge other sources of support are of
course acceptable, but the specific award numbers (OAC-1836650 and/or PHY-2323298)
for IRIS-HEP must be included. Most activities may have contributions (in 2024 and
2025) from both awards, but as we go along newer activities (start in 2024 and beyond) may have been funded of course by PHY-2323298 alone and thus you can drop OAC-1836650.

## Referencing IRIS-HEP in Publications

If you need to reference/cite IRIS-HEP in a Publication (independent from the acknowledgement of funding
support as described above) you have several non-exclusive choices: you can reference one or both of the NSF award numbers
as above (OAC-1836650 and/or PHY-2323298), you can reference the website and you can reference the Strategic Plan (Update and Original) and/or
the Community White Paper that led to IRIS-HEP. BibTex entries for these would be:

## Use of arXiv for conference proceedings

When publications intended for inclusion in conference proceedings are
submitted to the conference, they should **also** be submitted as a preprint
to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). Given the typically very long latencies for
official proceedings to appear, publishing a preprint early on the arXiv allows
them to be referenced and read soon after the conference. Subsequent
revisions due (for example) to feedback from referees of the conference
proceedings should **also** be uploaded to the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as
new versions of the original submission.
