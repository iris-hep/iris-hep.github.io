# Grand Challenges

IRIS-HEP is establishing institute-wide “Grand Challenges” to assess our progress toward the primary institute high-level goals. These challenges are meant to frame and organize many of the specific milestones and deliverables in IRIS-HEP. As these challenges will be organized together with the US LHC Operations programs, the LHC experiments and other partners, we expect some future evolution and iteration in the overall scope and timeline.

More information about the ongoing Grand Challenges are provided on dedicated pages:
