The long-term sustainability of the research software ecosystem is particularly
important for HEP, given that the HL-LHC and other facilities of the 2020s will
be relevant through at least the 2030s. The IRIS-HEP Software Sustainability
Core (SSC) focuses on activities which promote the long-term sustainability of
the software. The SSC has primarily focused on **Training, Education and
Outreach**.

To implement this vision, IRIS-HEP has developed a program to
provide software training paths from a researcher's first steps through more
regular, active contribution along with its partners: [HSF][], [FIRST-HEP][] and the
[Carpentries][]. In particular, it has developed an [introductory HEP software
curriculum][] and several software modules on techniques and methods for computing
and data science.  The training program has enabled HEP users to jump start
their research and contribution to the field. The common efforts on training
across HEP has helped build a strong sense of community.

Our efforts have established a platform from where we can scale and sustain our
training efforts. Our training vision is reflected in the pyramid below.

IRIS-HEP team members help organize events, develop training material and
participate as lecturers at all levels of this training vision. We organize and
run the annual [Computational and Data Science for High Energy Physics
(CoDaS-HEP) summer school][CoDaS-HEP] at Princeton and provide additional professional
development for the most advanced students and postdocs by supporting
connections with mentors through the [IRIS-HEP Fellows Program][]. Integrated with
this is a robust outreach program to engage local communities. This is
essential to train STEM students in software at K-12 level by partnering with
their teachers. These steps create a workforce capable of solving software
challenges in general and those of HEP in particular.


#### Best Practices

IRIS-HEP continues to document, disseminate, and work towards community
adoption of the best practices (from HEP and beyond) in the areas of software
sustainability, including topics in software engineering, data/software
preservation, and reproducibility. Of particular importance are best practices
surrounding the modernization of the software development process for
scientists.
