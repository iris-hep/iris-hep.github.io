  The Open Science Grid (OSG) facilitates access to distributed high throughput computing
  for research in the U.S. and worldwide.
  The resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by the community,
  organized by the OSG, and governed by the OSG Consortium.
  The OSG-LHC part of the IRIS-HEP project contains those aspects of the overall OSG program of work 
  that are specific to the U.S. LHC projects.
  
  U.S. ATLAS (contributing to ATLAS as a whole) relies extensively on services and software provided by OSG,
  as well as on processes and support systems that have been developed and implemented by OSG.
  OSG is essential for the operation of the worldwide-distributed ATLAS computing facility
  and the OSG efforts have aided the integration with WLCG partners in Europe and Asia.
  
  OSG provides infrastructure software maintenance and integration,
  through its packaging of all of the components that make up the OSG software releases.
  This software forms the backbone of the U.S. CMS distributed high-throughput computing efforts.
  OSG distributes the CMS software to U.S. CMS sites through its CernVM File System (CVMFS) service.
  It handles registration, monitoring and accounting activities for sites
  (the latter via the GRÃ…CC product), allowing CMS to track usage of OSG resources
  and then report it to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).
