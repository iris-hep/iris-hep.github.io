  [OSG](https://opensciencegrid.org) is a consortium dedicated to the
  advancement of all of open science via the practice of distributed High Throughput Computing (dHTC),
  and the advancement of its state of the art.
  It is a collaboration between IT, software, and science organizations.
  The consortium coordinates human and computing resources from a wide range of funded projects towards the aforementioned goal.
  It is governed by the [OSG Council](https://opensciencegrid.org/council/),
  maintaining its [by-laws](https://opensciencegrid.org/council/documents/OSG-By-Laws-2020%20-%20v2.pdf),
  and electing an [executive director](https://opensciencegrid.org/about/team.html) for 2 year renewable terms.
  The Executive Director works with an Executive Team to coordinate the program of work across funded projects.

  OSG-LHC contributes to the larger mission of the OSG Consortium
  by evolving the production infrastructure the LHC collaborations depend on in the USA
  towards the needs of the HL-LHC science program.
  As such, OSG-LHC is specifically focused on those aspects of the infrastructure
  that are shared between the US ATLAS and US CMS Operations programs.

  As of 2021, the production infrastructure accessible via OSG-LHC supported infrastructure software comprises
  roughly 1/3 of the global computing infrastructure of the LHC science program,
  thus being the single largest national contribution to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid.
