  The Blueprint Activity is designed to inform the development and evolution of the IRIS-HEP strategic vision. At its core, it is a [series of workshops](https://indico.cern.ch/category/11329) that bring together IRIS-HEP team members, key stakeholders and domain experts from disciplines of importance to the Instituteâ€™s mission. The Blueprint Activity facilitates the Institute's role as an intellectual hub for software and computing R&D in high-energy particle physics and beyond.
