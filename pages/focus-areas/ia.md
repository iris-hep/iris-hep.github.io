Algorithms to perform the real-time processing in the trigger and
the reconstruction of both real and simulated detector data are
critical components of HEPâ€™s computing challenge. University
personnel, including graduate students and post-docs working on
physics research grants, frequently develop and maintain innovative
algorithms and implementations. These algorithms face a number of
new challenges in the next decade due to new and upgraded accelerator
facilities, detector upgrades and new detector technologies, increases
in anticipated event rates, and emerging computing architectures.
Tracking for the HL-LHC is an area in particular need of novel
approaches, though the Institute will pursue other high-impact
applications. The Institute will employ a wide range of strategies
for the development of Innovative Algorithms.
