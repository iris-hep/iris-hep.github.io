The goal of the Analysis Systems focus area is to develop sustainable
analysis tools to extend the physics reach of the HL-LHC experiments
by creating greater functionality, reducing time-to-insight, lowering
the barriers for smaller teams, and streamlining analysis preservation,
reproducibility, and reuse.

Focus Area Strategies:

* Establish declarative specifications for analysis tasks and workflows that will enable the technical development of analysis systems to be decoupled from the user- facing semantics of physics analysis.
* Leverage and align with developments from industry and the broader scientific software community to enhance sustainability of the analysis systems.
* Develop high-throughput, low-latency systems for analysis for HEP.
* Integrate analysis capture and reuse as first class concepts and capabilities into the analysis systems.
