  Together with the OSG-LHC, the Scalable Systems Laboratory (SSL) is designed to be the primary integration path to deliver the output of IRIS-HEP R&D activities into the distributed and scientific production infrastructure of the experiments. SSL [hardware resources](https://ml.ssl-hep.org/hardware) can be [accessed through a gateway](https://ml.ssl-hep.org) for testing, training and other activities.
