  The HL-LHC era will provide enormous challenges in the area of Data Organization,
  Management and Access (DOMA).  The LHC will provide a significantly increased number
  of events and increased event complexity, both of which will drive much larger
  data sizes - with no changes in how the LHC community functions, the total increase
  in data volume may be a factor of 30.

  Given the LHC experiments are, combined, managing nearly an exabyte of data, such a
  significant increase in volume is unmanageable.  New mechanisms and techniques are
  necessary to more efficiently manage storage resources; the DOMA area in IRIS-HEP
  is working on the R&D necessary to affect such change.

  It is not only data volumes that are potentially disruptive to the HL-LHC physics
  program; the extraordinarily large number of events (potentially 150 billion
  similated and recorded events per year per experiment) presents a challenge in
  data management for users.  Along with the analysis systems team within IRIS,
  DOMA is working on improved techniques for delivering events to users.
