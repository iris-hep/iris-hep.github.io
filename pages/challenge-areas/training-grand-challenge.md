# Training Grand Challenge

We are now working to define, with the larger community, a series of specific goals for the period 2021-2023 in four categories and to work with the community to achieve them.

  * **Scalability** - We aim for sufficient scalability in the training activities such that all students and postdocs can receive training in both the introductory material and the more advanced material. In the steady state we expect a required scale approximately equal to the number of incoming students each year.
  * **Sustainability** - We aim to develop community processes by which both the instructors involved in training activities, and the training materials themselves, are continually renewed and meet the other two goals.
  * **Training Scope** - We aim for a curriculum (introductory, intermediate, advanced) that broadly meets the needs of the community and evolves over time as needed.
  * **Diversity and Inclusion** - The participation in the training should be representative of our community and (as we engage earlier in the pipeline) should work to represent the society at large
