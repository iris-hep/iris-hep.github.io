The Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics
(IRIS-HEP) is a center for software R&D, functions as an intellectual hub for
the larger community-wide software R&D efforts, and aims to transform the
operational services required to ensure the success of the HL-LHC scientific
program. It is a software institute funded by the National Science Foundation.

Princeton University and IRIS-HEP is committed to equal opportunity and non-discrimination. To maximize excellence, we seek talent from all segments of American society and the world, and we take steps to ensure everyone at Princeton and IRIS-HEP can thrive while they are here. That is the sole rationale and purpose of our diversity and inclusion programs, all of which are voluntary and open to all, and which comply with federal and state non-discrimination laws. Princeton and IRIS-HEP does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, disability, or any other protected characteristic, and Princeton and IRIS-HEP does not provide special benefits or preferential treatment on the basis of a protected characteristic.  

The entire team at IRIS-HEP strives to create an environment that
makes interactions and collaborations enjoyable and fulfilling while
eliminating discrimination, harassment, exploitation, and intimidation.

We expect the entire IRIS-HEP team to promote the following best practices with
regard to diversity, equity, and inclusion:

* Affirm that promoting opportunity must be consistent, ongoing, and is an active
  process that requires engagement;
* Promote awareness of perspectives that may have been previously inaccessible
  (or less prominent) to groups traditionally represented in scientific
  research environments;
* Believe that diversification requires cultural, experiential, and ideological
  representation from all segments of American society and the world
* Aim to foster an environment where all perspectives are valued because they
  serve to advance the Institute’s academic excellence and intellectual
  capacity, and will contribute to a more productive and respectful
  professional environment.
