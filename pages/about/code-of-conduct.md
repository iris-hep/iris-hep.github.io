The success of IRIS-HEP depends on its ability to engage a community from
collaborating institutions and disciplines with diverse skills, personalities
and experiences.

We are outlining here a set of principles and processes to support and promote
a healthy community and make IRIS-HEP a welcoming and productive community.

* Foster an open, productive, harassment-free environment for everyone.
* Be welcoming and support people of all backgrounds and identities,
  immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
  orientation, gender identity and expression, age, physical appearance, family
  status, technological choices, academic discipline, political views,
  religion, mental ability, and physical ability.
* Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
  depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
  decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community. You may be
  communicating with someone with a different primary language or cultural
  background.
* Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
  excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
  personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
  feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Respect the work of others. We recognize the acknowledgment/citation requests
  of the original authors. As authors, we are explicit about how we want our
  own work to be cited or acknowledged.
* Be considerate in the words you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or
  put down other community members. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior
  are not acceptable.
* When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and
  technical, happen all the time and the IRIS-HEP community is no exception.
  Try to understand where others are coming from, as seeing a question from
  their viewpoint may help find a new path forward. And don’t forget that it is
  human to err: blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, while we can learn
  from mistakes to find better solutions.
* A simple apology can go a long way. It can often de-escalate a situation, and
  telling someone that you are sorry is an act of empathy that doesn't
  automatically imply an admission of guilt.

As a member of our community, you are also a steward of these values. Not all
problems need to be resolved via formal processes, and often a quick, friendly
but clear word on an online forum or in person can help resolve a
misunderstanding and de-escalate things.

However, sometimes these informal processes may be inadequate: they fail to
work, there is urgency or risk to someone, nobody is intervening publicly and
you don’t feel comfortable speaking in public, etc. For these or other reasons,
structured follow-up may be necessary and here we provide the means for that
(see [Reporting section](#discussing-andor-reporting-your-concerns)).

This code of conduct applies equally to all community members in all Institute
situations online and offline, including conferences, training events, mailing
lists, forums, GitHub organizations, chat rooms, social media, social events
associated with conferences and events, and one-to-one interactions.

> IRIS-HEP will seek opportunities for education and training on diversity,
> inclusivity, reporting, and bystander intervention techniques. There is a plan
> to offer a DEI workshop in the coming months which will be facilitated by
> Princeton University.

### Discussing and/or Reporting Your Concerns

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct or if you have specific
concerns, please report this in a timely manner. Code of conduct violations
reduce the value of the community for everyone and we take them seriously.

Please contact any member of the IRIS-HEP Executive Board or email Floe
Fusin-Wischusen, Institute Manager, Princeton Institute for Computational
Science & Engineering at [floe@princeton.edu](mailto:floe@princeton.edu).
