project_title: Integrating MadAnalysis and pyhf into Recast-workflow
focus-area:
project_goal: >
    Recast-workflow is able to quickly construct new truth-level reinterpretations to determine which regions of phase space would be interesting for a full reinterpretation that is much more computationally expensive and difficult to make. It accomplishes this by simplyifing the process to 3 steps: generation, selection, and analysis. Recast-cli (command line interface for Recast-workflow) has been previously developed to provide a user interface for creating and executing new workflows compromised of several different combinations of options for each step. In RECAST-workflow’s current state, the workflows only run on the user’s local machine using RECAST-cli. The goal of this project is three fold: add new options for the selection step of RECAST-workflow besides Rivet (e.g. MadAnalsyis), add alternative statistical tools (e.g. pyhf), and to run the workflows in REANA on the cloud.
