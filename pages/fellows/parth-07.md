project_title: Add support for custom types in Clad with a focus on the Softsusy library.
project_goal: >
  User-defined types in C++ helps to make code more readable and maintainable. Many
  user-defined programs and almost every major library uses user-defined types. Thus
  it is very crucial for clad to support differentiating user-defined types. The first
  goal of the project is to add support for differentiating user-defined types in
  clad. Clad currently also does not support many C++ syntaxes. Many of these are
  essential and are very well used in day-to-day programming such as break and continue
  statements. The second goal of the project is to battle test clad on Eigen and softsusy
  library codebases to find and add support for most of the missing syntax as well
  as to improve support for differentiating function calls.
