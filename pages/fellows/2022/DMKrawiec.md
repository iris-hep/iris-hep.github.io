project_title: Conformal Mappings for Particle Track Reconstruction
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  Particle detectors like the HL-LHC record point clouds of hits;
  to reconstruct the trajectories of particles, it is necessary to determine
  which hits belong to these individual trajectories. This,
  along with the sparse nature of the detector data, makes graph neural networks
  (GNNs) a promising tool for particle tracking, given their strong
  performance on instance segmentation tasks.
  The GNN pipeline (Interaction Network) built by Dr. Thais' team
  extracts track parameters in addition to grouping hits belonging to the
  trajectories of individual particles. A conformal space mapping
  can be used for track fitting and consequently parameter extraction,
  and has the advantage of being computationally efficient compared to a helical fit.

  The goal of this project is to further improve the conformal space fit and its stability,
  and optimise certain aspects of the Interaction Network's architecture for this purpose.
