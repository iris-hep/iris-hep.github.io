project_title: Improvement of GNN-based algorithm for full-event filtering and interpretation at the LHCb trigger
project_goal: >
    Implement a new, distance-weighted, approach to improve the speed performance of a GNN-based algorithm, which is aimed to be used for filtering events and reconstructing the hierarchical decay chain at the LHCb trigger. Compare performance with the current architecture by running tests on the simulated events
