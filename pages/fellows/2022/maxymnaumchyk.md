projects:
- project_title: Integrating ML algorithms for LHC data compression into the ESCAPE Virtual Research Environment
  project_goal: >
    Integrate one of the current state-of-the-art ML algorithms designed for LHC data compression into the ESCAPE Virtual Research Environment as a part of the European Open Science Cloud. The successful results of the project will open the possibility of extending the use of this algorithm to other experiments and fields.
  mentors:
  - Caterina Doglioni (University of Manchester)

  proposal: /assets/pdf/fellows-2022/200-proposal-Maxym-Naumchyk.pdf
- project_title: Machine Learning on Network Data for Problem Identification
  project_goal: >
    To provide a more effective method of identifying certain types of network issues using machine learning so that such problems can be quickly resolved before they impact scientists who rely on these networks.
