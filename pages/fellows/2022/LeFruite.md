project_title: Role of Myocardin-Related Transcription Factors in the Smooth Muscle Cell gene program
project_goal: >
  In this project smooth muscle cells from the human coronary artery were treated with
  adenoviruses that express nothing (control group) or over-express myocardin (experimental group).
  There were 4 virus induced and 4 control samples. RNA was extracted from these cells and
  sequenced with paired-end reads on an illumina machine.
  The goal is to test how over-expression of myocarding affects other genes and to analyse the
  functional role of the affected genes.
