project_title: Sequence-read extraction from counting de Bruijn graphs
project_goal: >
    We will extend the MetaGraph framework by adding the sequence-read extraction option from the counting de Bruijn graphs. Hence given a sequence search result, all reads that overlap the parts of the graph that matched could be extracted and used in further downstream analysis.

mentors:
  - Andre Kahles (University of Zurich)
