project_title: Graph Generative Models For Fast Detector Simulations in Particle Physics
focus-area:
project_goal: >
  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the worldâ€™s highest energy particle accelerator,
  delivering the highest energy proton-proton collisions ever recorded in the
  laboratory, permitting a detailed exploration of elementary particle physics at the energy
  frontier. Simulating the particle showers and interactions in the LHC detectors
  is both time consuming and computationally expensive. Present fast simulation approaches
  based on non-parametric techniques can improve the speed of the full simulation
  chain but suffer from lower levels of fidelity. For this reason, alternative methods
  based on machine learning can provide faster solutions, while maintaining a high level
  of fidelity. The main goal of a fast simulator is to map the events from the generation
  level directly to the reconstruction level. The recent rise of deep generative models
  paved the way for novel AI-based simulation methods. These are characterized by a
  high ability to learn complex data features in a high dimensional space as probability
  distributions to reconstruct or simulate new samples from those data. Hence, generative
  models make great candidates for the representation learning of particle collision
  events. The most used generative architectures are Generative Adversarial Networks
  and Variational Auto-Encoders . Given the non-Euclidean nature of jet events
  data, we aim to investigatethe efficiency of graph generative models in simulating event
  reconstructions in a given detector.
