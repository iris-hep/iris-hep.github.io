projects:
- project_title: Integrating ML algorithms for LHC data compression into the ESCAPE Virtual Research Environment
  project_goal: >
    Integrate one of the current state-of-the-art ML algorithms designed for LHC data compression into the ESCAPE Virtual Research Environment as a part of the European Open Science Cloud. The successful results of the project will open the possibility of extending the use of this algorithm to other experiments and fields.
