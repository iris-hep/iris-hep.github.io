projects:
- project_title: Development of high-performance reconstruction algorithms for detecting long-lived particles
  project_goal: >
    Development of new Artificial Intelligence applications that are impossible to implement with the current hardware solutions due to the requirements of high-speed response and power constraints. Development and implementation of particle reconstruction algorithms using GPUs and/or FPGAs, as well as the real-time processing of massive data from the LHCb experiment. This will be crucial for detecting long-lived particles predicted in new physics models, and also interesting for industrial and real-life applications.
  mentors:
  -  Arantza Oyanguren (IFIC - University of Valencia/CSIC, Spain)
  proposal: /assets/pdf/fellows-2022/201-proposal-Volodymyr-Svintozelskyi.pdf
- project_title: New trigger lines dedicated to long-lived particle detection at the LHCb experiment
  project_goal: >
    Development of new algorithms and software for the high level trigger lines at the LHCb experiment. These will be crucial to detect new long-lived particles during Run3 of the LHC proton-proton collider.
