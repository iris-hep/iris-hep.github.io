project_title: Development of high-performance reconstruction algorithms for detecting long-lived particles
project_goal: >
    Development of new Artificial Intelligence applications that are impossible to implement with the current hardware solutions due to the requirements of high-speed response and power constraints. Development and implementation of particle reconstruction algorithms using GPUs and/or FPGAs, as well as the real-time processing of massive data from the LHCb experiment. This will be crucial for detecting long-lived particles predicted in new physics models, and also interesting for industrial and real-life applications.
