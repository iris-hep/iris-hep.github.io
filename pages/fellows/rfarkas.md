project_title: Combinatorial Kalman Filter for the ACTS tracking software
project_goal: >
  The reconstruction of trajectories of charged particles is a crucial task for most HEP experiments. The ACTS (A Common Tracking Software) aims to provide an experiment-independent suite of tools that enable future high-energy particle physics experiments to implement their full track reconstruction chain. I will be working on the implementation and validation of a Combinatorial Kalman Filter (CKF) in the ACTS framework.
