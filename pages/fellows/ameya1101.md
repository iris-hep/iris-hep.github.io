project_title: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Particle Tracking
project_goal: >
    Tracking devices, or trackers, at the LHC record hits of charged particles produced in
    a collision event. The task of track reconstruction involves clustering tracker hits to
    reconstruct the trajectories of these particles. The sparse nature of tracking data makes
    graph neural networks (GNNs) well-suited to particle tracking applications. The goal of
    this project is to develop a GNN for particle tracking by explicitly incorporating E(3)
    equivariance into the model. Incorporating physically meaningful symmetries into the GNN
    can reduce the number of parameters and potentially reduce training and inference times
    for the model, while retaining the expressive power of non-equivariant GNNs.
