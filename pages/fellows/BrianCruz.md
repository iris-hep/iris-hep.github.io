project_goal: >
  Translate the Higgs boson decay into four leptons CMS open data physics analysis
  example into a prototype analysis system using Coffea and Awkward-array. This prototype
  will be benchmarked and compared to the original approach to see if it has a reduced
  time-to-insight, greater functionality, and reusability.
