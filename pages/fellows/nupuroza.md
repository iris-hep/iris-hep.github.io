project_title: Implementation of ML algorithms for ambiguity resolution in ACTS track reconstruction
focus-area:
project_goal: >
    The high-pileup of collisions associated with the upgrade of the HL-LHC will offer serious computational limitations to particle tracking. ACTS, an experiment independent tool for track reconstruction, is especially CPU-expensive in its ambiguity solving step. To mitigate this, this project seeks to implement ML-based algorithms for ambiguity solving and final track resolution within ACTS.
