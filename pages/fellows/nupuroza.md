project_title: Implementation of ML algorithms for ambiguity resolution in ACTS track
  reconstruction
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  The high-pileup of collisions associated with the upgrade of the HL-LHC will offer
  serious computational limitations to particle tracking. ACTS, an experiment independent
  tool for track reconstruction, is especially CPU-expensive in its ambiguity solving
  step. To mitigate this, this project seeks to implement ML-based algorithms for
  ambiguity solving and final track resolution within ACTS.
