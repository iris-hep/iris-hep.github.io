project_title: Advanced ML Techniques and Hybrid Dual-Readout Systems for Electroweak Jet Identification and Particle Flow Enhancement in Future Collider Detectors
project_goal: >
    The major goal of the project is to develop segmented crystal dual-readout calorimeters integrated with advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the identification and analysis of electroweak jets. This involves optimizing the calorimeter design for improved photon and neutral hadron separation, analyzing weak boson splitting within jets, and refining centroid measurements for accurate 3-momentum calculations. These advancements aim to overcome current limitations in jet energy measurements, providing deeper insights and contributing to the future development of high-energy physics detectors.
