    Coffea development for LHC experiments: Development of coffea to support multiple LHC experiment analysis workflows.
project_goal: >
    As Coffea is adopted across various HEP experiments with diverse data formats, maintaining user-friendly and performant experiment-specific schemas becomes complex. This project aims to enhance developer and user experience with Coffea schemas by updating and validating the ATLAS-specific PHYSLITE schema.
