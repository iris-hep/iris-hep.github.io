project_title: Data Compression Analysis in the ATLAS Experiment
project_goal: >
    CERN’s experiments generate huge datasets, and
reducing their size through compression lowers costs and environmental impact
by decreasing storage needs and energy consumption. A study will be conducted to assess how lossy com-
pression affects online tracking performance estimation, comparing compressed data against uncompressed benchmarks.
