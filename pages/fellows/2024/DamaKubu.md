project_title: Data Compression Analysis in the ATLAS Experiment
project_goal: >
  CERNâ€™s experiments generate huge datasets, and reducing their size through compression lowers costs and environmental impact by decreasing storage needs and energy consumption. A study will be conducted to assess how lossy compression affects online tracking performance estimation, comparing compressed data against uncompressed benchmarks.
