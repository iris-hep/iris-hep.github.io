project_title: >
  Develop of Clad Tutorials for CMS/HEP
project_goal: >
  In this project, we will focus on creating a Clad based demonstration of finding the best fit helix parameters given a set of data points. Given the short timescale of the project, the complexity of the resulting tutorial will depend on complexities encountered during the research. At the same time, during the project, demos and reproducers of various Clad functionalities will be built and tested. Another goal of this project will be to contribute Clad code fixing the missing functionalities that we find along the way, such as adding support for the atan2 function differentiation.
