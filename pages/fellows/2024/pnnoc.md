project_title: Improving the Analysis Grand Challenge (AGC) Machine Learning Workflow
project_goal: >
  Improving the AGC workflow by implementing Graph Neural Network (GNN) to the pipeline. Investigating the performance, computational cost, and users' experience of GNN compared to the existing Boosted Decision Tree (BDT). Exploring varieties of GNN architecture that would relfex physical phenomena.
