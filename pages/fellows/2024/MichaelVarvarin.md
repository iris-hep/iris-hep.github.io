project_title: Extending the Alpaka performance portability library with CUDA Cooperative Groups for the CMS pixel reconstruction
project_goal: >
    This project aims to enhance the Alpaka API to support launching Alpaka kernels utilizing CUDA Cooperative Groups. It will involve a detailed examination of Alpaka's current accelerator and kernel launch mechanisms to identify integration points for cooperative group functionalities. The result of the project will be a prototype of Alpaka with support for CUDA Cooperative Groups. Should the final prototype be feature-ready, it will be tested within the CMS Pixeltrack project.
