project_title: Advancing the Hist library
project_goal: >
    Hist is a powerful Histogramming tool for analysis based on boost-histogram. It is a friendly analysis-focused project that uses boost-histogram as a backend to do the work, but provides plotting tools, shortcuts, and new ideas.<br/><br/>
    To advance the Hist library further, this project proposes the implementation of various features, testing, improved documentation and tutorials. This would help in improving the performance, usability, accessibility and scope of functionality of the library.
