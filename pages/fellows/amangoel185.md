projects:
- project_title: Hist Serialization and Interactivity
  project_goal: >
    This project proposes the development of the Hist library further via the implementation
    of new features and advanced functionality such as serialization, interpolator
    integration and improved reprs. It would also address bug fixes, test coverage
    and documentation.<br/><br/>
    Further, it proposes the development of the uproot-browser into a fully functional
    library that would be based on textual and be able to view histograms. It would
    have a tree-like browser on the left, a plotext based plot viewer on the right
    and a potential control box below the plot. It would enable a user to browse and
    look inside a ROOT file, completely via the terminal.

- project_title: Advancing the Hist library
  project_goal: >
    Hist is a powerful Histogramming tool for analysis based on boost-histogram. It
    is a friendly analysis-focused project that uses boost-histogram as a backend
    to do the work, but provides plotting tools, shortcuts, and new ideas.<br/><br/>
    To advance the Hist library further, this project proposes the implementation
    of various features, testing, improved documentation and tutorials. This would
    help in improving the performance, usability, accessibility and scope of functionality
    of the library.
