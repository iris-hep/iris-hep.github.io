project_goal: >
  The currently available bindings for fastjet are old and hard to maintain, therefore,
  in this project we aim to remake the python bindings from the groundup using pybind11
  and integrating support from several different python libraries such as Vector and
  Awkward Array to fecilitate easier handling of data and simpler maintanence in future
  and to ensure that the later additions to the fastjet library can be brought to
  python with little to no effort.
