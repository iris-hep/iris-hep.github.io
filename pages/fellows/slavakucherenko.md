project_title: Machine Learning Based Tracking and Trigger
project_goal: >
    We propose to use AI/ML to perform software-based triggering processing and recognise complex patterns of particle decays. This project will focus on tracking algorithms, which can effectively identify tracks of the particles, having the phase-space distribution of points on detectors. Using geometrical constraints and a graph neural networks approach it is possible not only to identify tracks but also to apply trigger detection classification on the preprocessed tracks. After having a model, the goal would be to fine-tune the best approaches and compare their final metrics.
