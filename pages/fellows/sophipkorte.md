project_title: Geometric Machine Learning for Particle Tracking
project_goal: >
    This project uses machine learning methods, specifically Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as a way of reconstructing the trajectories of particles. The goal is to evaluate the performance of the GNN tracking algorithms and compare them to the CMS algorithms currently in use.
