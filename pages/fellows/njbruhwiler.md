project_title: Muon Collider Tracking Software
project_goal: >
     A muon-collider is an option for future high-energy physics. However, because of the short lifetime of a muon, the detector has to cope with a large rate of beam-induced background caused by muon decay products. The algorithms used for charged particle reconstruction (tracking) need to successfully differentiate this noise from products of the main muon-muon collision, which results in a very large conbinatorial problem. This project involves investigating how the tracking algorithms can be improved and, if time allows, focusing on the optimization of the algorithm and the detector layout.
