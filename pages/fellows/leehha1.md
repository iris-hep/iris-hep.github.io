project_title: Estimating transfer times of large datasets for scientific computing
project_goal: >
    This project will continue the existing research of the Rucio team on the estimation of the duration of file transfers for large scale sciences. The distributed data management environment for scientific experiments forms a complex ecosystem with dynamic interactions between users and data centers.
    Rucio's central role as the data management system, and the rich amount of data gathered about the transfers and data rules life cycles will help in creating machine learning for transfer time estimation.
