project_title: Anomaly Detection with Spiking Neural Networks
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mimic organic systems like the human brain with asynchronous
  spikes, bridging the gap between artificial and biological intelligence and excelling
  at temporally-dependent data. The inherent strengths of these SNNs are extremely
  useful at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with their need for fast inference and
  accurate data-processing of petabytes of time-series events. This project involves
  the development of an anomaly detection algorithm based on SNNs and Autoencoders,
  which learn to identify outlier events in an unsupervised manner. This algorithm
  will complement LHC scientists in their search for beyond-standard-model physics,
  delivering a list of previously unidentified anomalous events.
