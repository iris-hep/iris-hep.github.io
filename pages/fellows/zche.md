project_goal: >
  Contribute to the further development of the Coffea-Casa Analysis Facility (AF) at University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), to expand a gallery of Coffea-Casa analysis samples with existing analysis from CMS adapted to be executed in AF@UNL. I will facilitate the use of Coffea-Casa AF for Boston University and UNL CMS physicists currently working with NanoAOD datasets and investigation of possibility to use Arrow Dataset API as an input to Coffea for further integration with Skyhook DM.
