project_title: GPU-accelerated Machine-learned Particle-flow Reconstruction
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  An important core software algorithm of the LHC is the particle-flow (PF) reconstruction
  algorithm, which takes disparate types of tracks and clusters reconstructed from
  different subdetectors and returns a list of final-state PF candidates. The nature
  of this task motivates the exploration of highly parallelizable machine learning
  (ML) models that are easier to accelerate with heterogeneous computing resources,
  such as GPUs and FPGAs, which gives them an advantage over traditional PF algorithms.
  This project proposes to apply state-of-the-art ML techniques, mainly graph neural
  networks (GNNs), which learn from non-Euclidean structured data, to the task of
  PF reconstruction in CMS and for LHC detectors more generally. Concrete deliverables
  of the project include providing publicly-available ML models for PF reconstruction
  and benchmarking their physics and computational performance on open datasets with
  coprocessing accelerators.
