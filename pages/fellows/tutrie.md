project_goal: >
  Current methods for computing excursion sets of black-box functions (equivalently
  finding iso-hypersurfaces of n-dimensional scalar multivariate functions) are embarrassingly
  parallel
  and computationally expensive. An active learning algorithm appropriately named
  â€˜excursionâ€™
  has reduced the compute resources necessary to find excursion sets so that researchers
  can quickly
  classify BSM theories. Using a Bayesian optimization procedure it can compute excursion
  sets in record
  times. Our goal is to scale this method so that it still works efficiently in higher
  dimensions. It will be
  extremely helpful in the search for new physics.
