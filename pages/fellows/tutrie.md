project_title: Advancing an active learning algorithm for more efficient generation of Monte Carlo for exclusion plots
focus-area: Innovative Algorithms
project_goal: >
 Current methods for computing excursion sets of black-box functions (equivalently
 finding iso-hypersurfaces of n-dimensional scalar multivariate functions) are embarrassingly parallel
 and computationally expensive. An active learning algorithm appropriately named ‘excursion’
 has reduced the compute resources necessary to find excursion sets so that researchers can quickly
 classify BSM theories. Using a Bayesian optimization procedure it can compute excursion sets in record
 times. Our goal is to scale this method so that it still works efficiently in higher dimensions. It will be
 extremely helpful in the search for new physics.
