project_title: Advancing an active learning algorithm for more efficient generation of Monte Carlo for exclusion plots
focus-area: Innovative Algorithms
project_goal: >
	Current methods for computing excursion sets of black-box functions (equivalently
	finding iso-hypersurfaces of n-dimensional scalar multivariate functions) are embarrassingly parallel
	and computationally expensive. An active learning algorithm appropriately named ‘excursion’
	has reduced the compute resources necessary to find excursion sets so that researchers can quickly
	classify BSM theories. Using a Bayesian optimization procedure it can compute excursion sets in record
	times. Our goal is to scale this method so that it still works efficiently in higher dimensions. It will be
	extremely helpful in the search for new physics.
