project_title: Algorithms for electron reconstruction in a Muon Collider
project_goal: >
    Muon colliders offer a resource efficient way to continue to conduct experiments science due to
    their (relatively) small size. These collider do bring up some immediate concerns such as the
    decay of muons into a large number of electrons inside of the accelerator loop. These electrons
    pose a challenge for detectors due to multiple scattering and bremsstrahlung effects which cause
    the electons to look like other particles. My project involves tweaking of input variables and
    modification of the ACTS portion of the iLCSoft software and analyzing the output in order to
    provide accurate and precise detection of elections.
