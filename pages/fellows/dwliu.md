project_goal: >
  ServiceX provides delivery of any requested portion of high energy physics data sets for analysis.
  The current version of the system has two transformers, which function for Python and C++.
  In this work, we will verify that both transformers produce the same outputs when queried.
  We will also develop multiple tests that can be rapidly run against ServiceX to test the whole system's
  functionality from beginning to end. This allows developers to rapidly find and fix bugs and test the
  software's stress limits.
