project_title: Improve Clingâ€™s packaging system, Cling Packaging Tool
project_goal: >
    Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter/compiler that utilizes the REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) paradigm for fast development and testing as well as immediate feedback and runtime-generated code. One of the many useful tools included in the Cling interpreter is the Cling Packaging Tool (CPT), which is a command line utility that can easily build Cling from source and generate installer bundles for a variety of platforms, including Ubuntu and Debian-based platforms, Windows, distributions based on Red Hat Linux, Mac OS X, and any Unix-like platform. While the CPT is an incredibly useful and flexible tool, there are several improvements that can be made to make the userâ€™s experience with the CPT even more seamless.
