project_title: Reproducible Open Benchmark Compatability with Jupyter Notebook
project_goal: >
    The Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB) is a platform that allows for the evaluation of different data analysis algorithms in a controlled competition-style format. But, it currently does not support python notebooks as input. The goal of this project is to add support for jupyter notebooks to the ROB.
