project_goal: >
  The prospect of the HL-LHC and the high pileup associated with it has made track reconstruction much more challenging. Following track reconstruction, an oﬄine algorithm that is able to distinguish real tracks (tracks associated with a single charged particle) from fake tracks (tracks not associated with a single charged particle) is beneﬁcial. The CMS software contains a DNN for this task; however, this is based on the current detector. For the phase 2 upgrade of the CMS detector, the outer tracker is quite diﬀerent which means that this task needs to be reevaluated. The goal of my project is to develop a more eﬃcient post track reconstruction algorithm using deep learning to classify reconstructed tracks as either real or fake.
