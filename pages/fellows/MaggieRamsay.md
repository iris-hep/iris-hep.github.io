project_goal: >
  Development of a continuous functionality testing procedure (including smoke tests
  and integration tests) for ‘Coffea-casa’ analysis facility. The test suite would
  expect to cover testing of analysis-related components and analysis frameworks deployed
  in AF as well as data delivery services functionality. The test suite should include
  but not be limited to an already collected set of available sample physics analyses.
