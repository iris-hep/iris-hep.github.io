project_title: Histograms Using Numba
focus-area: as
project_goal: >
  Recent developments in Scikit-HEP libraries have enabled efficient histogramming
  powered by boost-histogram and fitting into a larger ecosystem of users. Numba is
  a high-performance Python compiler that uses the industry-standard LLVM compiler
  library. To enable a fully Numba-enabled event loop for analyses, histogramming
  step needs to be implemented. In this summer, I will investigate ways to enable
  boost-histogramâ€™s histogramming fill from inside the LLVM Numba loop without stepping
  through Python.
