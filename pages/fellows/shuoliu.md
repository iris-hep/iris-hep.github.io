project_title: Histograms Using Numba
focus-area:
project_goal: >
    Recent developments in Scikit-HEP libraries have enabled efficient histogramming powered by boost-histogram and fitting into a larger ecosystem of users. Numba is a high-performance Python compiler that uses the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. To enable a fully Numba-enabled event loop for analyses, histogramming step needs to be implemented. In this summer, I will investigate ways to enable boost-histogramâ€™s histogramming fill from inside the LLVM Numba loop without stepping through Python.
