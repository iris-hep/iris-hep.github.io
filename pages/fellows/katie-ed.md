project_title: Geometric Machine Learning with DUNE
project_goal: >
    Throughout the duration of this project, my main goal is to improve tracking algorithms used in geometric machine learning experiments for the DUNE project. In addition, I will compare the DUNE results found from geometric machine learning and compare them with results using CNN reconstruction.
