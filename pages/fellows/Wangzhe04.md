project_title: Implement improved morphing strategy into MadMiner
project_goal:
    MadMiner is a Machine Learning-based inference tool that uses simulated events that can be re-weighted to describe distributions with different values for the physics parameters of interest.
    Currently, the available morphing technique in Madminer requires an inflexible distinct number of default physics parameter values (basis points) needed to use (the number varies depending on the physics process of interest).
    Thus, we propose to implement a new approach that relaxes the requirement which would allow researchers to pick additional physics parameter values as basis points while still being able to reweight to any other position in parameter space.
