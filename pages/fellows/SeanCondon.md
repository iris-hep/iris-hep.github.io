project_goal: >
 The LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider produces around 40 Tbits/s of data while running. The main goal of this project is to develop multivariate algorithms for run 3 of the LHCb experiment to select the interesting parts of this immense amount of data and discard the rest in real-time using only GPUs. To accomplish this, I will develop and evaluate many possible multivariate algorithms to find the best fitted for this task, and then deploy these into the baseline algorithm repository for LHCb run 3.
