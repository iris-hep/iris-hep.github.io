project_title: Analyzing Neutrino Interactions
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
 When neutrinos interact with each other, the result is close to a pixelated image. Once the image comes through it
 can be broken down and analyzed, and then put back together. This project will develop an algorithm to help
 analyze these images using simulated events from the DUNE experiment.
