project_title: Proactive Site Monitoring
project_goal: "Researchers using the OSG rely on the stability of resources in order to accomplish their science.  The OSGâ€™s GRACC accounting service collects usage information for all sites contributing to and all jobs that run on the OSG.  The accounting service is a large source of information on the OSG.  The accounting data is stored within an ElasticSearch database at UNL.  Monitoring using this accounting service exists that will alert when a site completely fails, but there is no alerting on a decrease in functionality of a site. My project would be to develop proactive site monitoring to alert on site issues detected from the GRACC accounting system.  The alert would run periodically on OSG resources."
