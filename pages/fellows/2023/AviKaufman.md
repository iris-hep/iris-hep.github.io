project_title: Understanding Data Popularity and Optimizing Access for Analysis
project_goal: >
  The aim of this project is to investigate data popularity and optimize data access to enhance data analysis efficiency. By studying data access patterns, we can identify frequently accessed datasets, prioritize their availability, and optimize resource utilization. This research is crucial in today's data-driven world as it can significantly improve decision-making processes and drive innovation. The project will involve familiarization with existing research, dataset collection and analysis, implementation of an intelligent data movement and placement engine, adaptive query optimization, monitoring, and exploration of innovative approaches.
