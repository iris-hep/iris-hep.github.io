project_title: Creating a lesson unit tests for the HSF Analysis Preservation Training
project_goal: >
    The HSF Analysis Preservation Training is made of several training modules:
    Docker, Singularity/Apptainer, and CI/CD using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
    Part of the CI/CD training is a very short introduction to pytest for unit testing
    in python. However, it currently offers barely more than a glimpse.
    While numerous other trainings introduce pytest in much more depth, they can be overwhelming
    for students, or otherwise don't fit with the training paradim of the lesson.
    This project creates a dedicated lesson on pytest that fits well with the
    remaining material of the Analysis Preservation Training.
