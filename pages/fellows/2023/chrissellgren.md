project_title: Improving Performance of Track Reconstruction Algorithms in a Muon Collider Detector
project_goal: >
    A muon collider is one of the most promising prospects for the near future of experimental high energy physics. Such a collider would push the energy frontier and open up possibility for precision measurement studies with a compact and sustainable accelerator design. However, the short lifetime of the particles in the beam introduces unprecedented tracking challenges in the detector design, as the decay products create a Beam Induced Background (BIB). This project will work to improve the performance of the track reconstruction algorithms used to filter tracks in a muon collider detector system. The project will involve a systematic study of the performance of current tracking algorithms and the creation of a set of benchmark requirements for the algorithms. Additionally, the project may involve porting the tracking algorithms to a software stack that takes advantage of multi-threading capacity and would greatly increase the computational efficiency of the simulations.
