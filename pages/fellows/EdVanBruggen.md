project_title: Expanding Subworkflow Catalog of RECAST-wf For Event Generators
focus-area:
project_goal: >
    RECAST is a framework for reinterpreting LHC analyses using Yadage computational workflows.  These workflows can be run on the researcherâ€™s own computer or through the cloud application REANA RECAST-workflow builds on RECAST in order to run truth-level reinterpretations which achieve much faster results by sacrificing complexity.  It also allows for workflows to be modularized through subworkflows which encapsulate each step (generation, selection, analysis).  The goal of this project is to improve the command line usability and documentation, improve MadGraph integration to support custom models, and add the additional event generators Sherpa and Herwig.
