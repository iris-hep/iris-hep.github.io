project_title: Expanding Subworkflow Catalog of RECAST-wf For Event Generators
focus-area:
project_goal: >
  RECAST is a framework for reinterpreting LHC analyses using Yadage computational
  workflows.  These workflows can be run on the researcherâ€™s own computer or through
  the cloud application REANA RECAST-workflow builds on RECAST in order to run truth-level
  reinterpretations which achieve much faster results by sacrificing complexity.  It
  also allows for workflows to be modularized through subworkflows which encapsulate
  each step (generation, selection, analysis).  The goal of this project is to improve
  the command line usability and documentation, improve MadGraph integration to support
  custom models, and add the additional event generators Sherpa and Herwig.
