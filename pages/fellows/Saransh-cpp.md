project_title: Vector - Constructors, documentation, and benchmarks
project_goal: >
    The user-facing API of Vector is a bit confusing as it does not expose
    its true API, which are the Python classes. The current API provides
    wrapper functions (named as obj, arr, and awk) to users which are also
    shown in the internal classes' __repr__ methods, making these constructor
    functions even more ambiguous. </br> </br>
    Additionally, the vector library lacks proper user as well as API
    documentation. Currently, there are no detailed explanations in the existing
    tutorials, and most of the functions and classes do not contain docstrings,
    which automatically render when displayed on the documentation website.
    Furthermore, benchmarking would be a valuable addition to the Vector project,
    which could then be propagated to all Scikit-HEP packages in the future. </br> </br>
    This project would aim to prepare Vector for its first major release
    by exposing its internal API to the users, improving the documentation,
    and adding benchmarks.
