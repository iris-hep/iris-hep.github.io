project_title: Enabling support for MiniAOD Transformer for ServiceX Data Delivery Service
project_goal: >
  The func_adl data query language has two backends
  that are currently part of ServiceX - one based on C++ for ATLAS data and CMS data, and one
  based on columnar processing using uproot and awkward arrays. The C++ backend currently runs
  only on the ATLAS binary format (xAOD) and CMS binary format (CMS AOD). This project aims
  to create an interface similar to the existing func_adl_xAOD repository, where both CMS
  AOD and ATLAS xAOD backends are available, such that the user can send hierarchical
  SQL-like queries to a MiniAOD backend. The project also includes the required modifications of
  the C++ ServiceX backend to allow processing the publicly available CMS MiniAOD binary files.
