project_title: CMS Jet Reconstruction with Quantile Neural Networks
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  This project seeks to improve upon a previously developed algorithm which uses deep
  networks to build a set of potential jets from the Particle Flow particles in the
  CMS detector. Through using a quantile loss function, these networks are trained
  to predict an output corresponding to a given quantile, allowing full distributions
  to be predicted. If effective this algorithm will be able to streamline much of
  the jet reconstruction process through a single process.
