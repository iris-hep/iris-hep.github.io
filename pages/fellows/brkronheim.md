project_title: CMS Jet Reconstruction with Quantile Neural Networks
project_goal: >
    This project seeks to improve upon a previously developed algorithm which uses deep networks to build a set of potential jets from the Particle Flow particles in the CMS detector. Through using a quantile loss function, these networks are trained to predict an output corresponding to a given quantile, allowing full distributions to be predicted. If effective this algoritm will be able to streamline much of the jet reconstruction process through a single process.
