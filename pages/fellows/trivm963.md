project_title: Creating a User Interface to Analyse Network Topology
focus-area:
project_goal: >
    The LHC-OSG Network Monitoring Area gathers and makes accessible various network metrics related to network performance in order to debug complex network  problems more effectively. This is a unique dataset with continuous measurements of thousands of research and education network paths. It can be challenging to identify network problems and, more importantly, their location. The goal of my project is to create a network topology analysis web interface to aid with debugging and localizing network performance issues. This will be mostly focussed on path analysis: finding commonalities between paths, finding paths that contain a given address, correlating paths with other network metrics, and the degree of path symmetry.
