project_title: Muon Collider Tracking Software
project_goal: >
  The goal of my project is to investigate options to reduce the effect of noise caused by secondary particles in particle path reconstruction by analyzing the effects of directional information from specially arranged silicon-detector layers being used with existing path reconstruction algorithms through muon collider simulations in C++
