focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  The goal of my project is to investigate options to reduce the effect of noise caused
  by secondary particles in particle path reconstruction by analyzing the effects
  of directional information from specially arranged silicon-detector layers being
  used with existing path reconstruction algorithms through muon collider simulations
  in C++

- Sergo Jindariani (Fermilab)
