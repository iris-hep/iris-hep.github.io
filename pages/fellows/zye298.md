project_title: Add network measuring to data federation caches
project_goal: >
    The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) will bring a tremendous increase in data volume.  It is critical to ensure that the transfer and reuse of data works well in distributed data federations. Therefore, adding network performance tooling for data caching federations are needed. The expected outcome is a network measuring tool that is developed using Kubernetes deployments that orchestrate cache and perfSONAR containers to monitor the data transfer between origins and caches.
