project_title: Creating a Python Front-End for HLS Implementation of GNNs on FPGA
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  FPGA-implementation of GNN particle-tracking algorithms can reduce latency to the
  speeds necessary for tracking at the LHC, but the catch is that FPGA/HLS design
  is time and effort intensive. This hinders the speed with which we can implement
  and test new GNN structures and training paradigms. This project proposes to develop
  a Python front-end which converts trained pytorch.geometric GNN models into identical
  HLS representations, and to integrate this functionality into the hls4ml toolkit.
  This functionality will allow us to keep up with new developments in GNNs such as
  quantization-aware training, which may further reduce latency and resource usage
  while providing less lossiness than post-training quantization.
