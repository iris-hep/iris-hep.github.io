project_title: Implementation of graph neural networks on CPU + FPGA co-processors
  for scalable track reconstruction tasks
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  Run 2 of the LHC on the CMS detector produced a data rate on the scale of hundreds
  of terabytes per second. Being able to reduce the data within a few milliseconds
  and sift through the data in a reasonable time frame to produce meaningful results
  is crucially important. Future increases in instantaneous luminosity, meaning more
  proton-proton collisions per bunch-crossing, will lead to data produced at increasingly
  larger rates, causing scalability issues in traditional particle track reconstruction
  algorithms. This project proposes to implement a graph network that can be evaluated
  on a CPU that has a FPGA co-processors. This will allow trained networks to be run
  online in a highly parallelized fashion, greatly accelerating data throughput.
