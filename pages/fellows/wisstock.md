project_title: Investigation of stimulus-specific expression of multiple ITFs in different hippocampal cell types by smFISH data automatic analysis pipeline
project_goal: >
    The goal of the project is to create a Python module for analyzing of RNA smFISH images with automatic mRNA spots counting simultaneously for many target genes and simultaneous integration with the segmentation of individual anatomical regions of the hippocampus, cell counting, and cell typing by expression of specific markers.
