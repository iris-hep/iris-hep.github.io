project_title: Developing Lorentz Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Top Quark
  Tagging
project_goal: >
  Top quark tagging is the process of labeling quarks and gluons from particle accelerator
  data. Machine learning helps automate this labeling process to help us understand
  physics and test theories. The goal of this project is to use graph neural networks
  to improve the accuracy of the labeling process and also imposing Lorentz symmetry
  into the network architecture to greatly reduce the training time.
