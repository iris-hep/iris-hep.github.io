project_goal: >
  Floating-point estimation errors have been a testament to the finite nature of computing.
  Moreover, the predominance of Floating-point numbers in real-valued computation
  does not help that fact. Float computations are highly dependent on precision, and
  in most cases, very high precision calculation is not only not possible but very
  inefficient. Here, one has no choice but to resort to lower precision computing,
  which in turn is quite prone to errors. These errors result in inaccurate and sometimes
  catastrophic results; hence, it is imperative to estimate these errors accurately.
  This project aims to use Clad, a source transformation AD tool for C++ implemented
  as a plugin for the C++ compiler Clang, to develop a generic error estimation framework
  that is not bound to a particular error approximation model. It will allow users
  to select their preferable estimation logic and automatically generate functions
  augmented with code for the specified error estimator.
