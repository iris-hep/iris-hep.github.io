project_goal: >
  Development of a continuous functionality testing procedure (including smoke tests and integration tests) for ‘Coffea-casa’ analysis facility. The test suite would expect to cover testing of analysis-related components and analysis frameworks deployed in AF as well as data delivery services functionality. The test suite should include but not be limited to an already collected set of available sample physics analyses.
