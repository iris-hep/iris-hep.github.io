project_title: Exploring the FAIR principles for preservation of UFO models
project_goal: >
    The Universal FEYNRULES Output (UFO) model, used for new physics beyond the Standard Model, stores different information of the particle model, in a generator-independent way, into different PYTHON files. This project aims to create a set of tools, guided by the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Principles, as a bridge among the developers and users of UFO models. For developers, a central, public repository will be published to handle registration and verification of the UFO models, allowing UFO developers to submit and register their model via the git CLI. For user, an API built will be developed to search for UFO models using keywords.
