project_title: Enable Dask interopability with xrootd-accessible storage systems
project_goal: >
    Develop an implementation of fsspec, a popular data storage API, that enables it to work with the xrootd accessible storage systems common in HEP. The implementation will enable Dask, and other data analysis Python packages that use fsspec, to work seamlessly with xrootd. The final product will be a middleware software package containing the implmenation itself along with docs, tests and examples.
