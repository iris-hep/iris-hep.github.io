project_title: Automating Awkward Array Testing
focus-area:
project_goal: >
    Awkward Array is a popular library for nested, variable-sized data, including
    arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using NumPy-like idioms.
    The project involves automating tests for various “Kernel Functions” in the library by working
    on selecting appropriate input values for test cases of the kernel functions.
    Here Hypothesis Testing Tool would be used to let off the load a bit by using various
    statistical methods for testing. The Kernel Functions would soon be implemented in CUDA therefore this project work would prove to be the genesis of the understanding that the CUDA implementations are
    correct and good to work with.
