project_title: Automating Awkward Array Testing
focus-area: as
project_goal: >
  Awkward Array is a popular library for nested, variable-sized data, including
  arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using NumPy-like
  idioms.
  The project involves automating tests for various “Kernel Functions” in the library
  by working
  on selecting appropriate input values for test cases of the kernel functions.
  Here Hypothesis Testing Tool would be used to let off the load a bit by using various
  statistical methods for testing. The Kernel Functions would soon be implemented
  in CUDA therefore this project work would prove to be the genesis of the understanding
  that the CUDA implementations are
  correct and good to work with.
