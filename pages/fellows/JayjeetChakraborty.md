project_title: Reproducible, large-scale SkyhookDM experiments
project_goal: >
  SkyhookDM injects programmable data management and data storage capabilities directly
  in the storage layer of distributed object databases such as Ceph. SkyhookDM utilizes and extends
  the Ceph distributed object storage platform with customized C++ object classes that enable
  database operations such as SELECT, PROJECT, AGGREGATE to be offloaded directly into the
  object storage layer, allowing applications to efficiently query multi-dimensional
  arrays. Compiling ceph along with Skyhook and running benchmark tests consists of a number of
  steps and can become irreproducible at times. The aim of this project is to implement a
  reproducible workflow with Popper to automate large-scale tests on different cloud
  infrastructure like GCP, Cloudlab and Kubernetes clusters and benchmark SkyhookDM at the 10's of terabyte
  scale over the various supported data formats.
