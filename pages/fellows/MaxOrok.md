project_goal: >
  Develop a CMSSW output module to generate nanoAOD files using the RNTuple format. This will help validate the RNTuple class design in the context of a large experiment framework and allow for comparisons between the TTree and RNTuple formats for compact analysis object data (AOD) files.
