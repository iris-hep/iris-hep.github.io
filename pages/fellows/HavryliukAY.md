projects:
  - project_title: Data Classification with PointNet++ for the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber at FRIB
  project_goal: >
    We have an Active-Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) detector, which consists of a gas chamber (the detector gas is at the same time the target               material), a source of magnetic and electric fields, and the pad plane on which particles are detected. The task is to extract information from the data           that we receive on the detector, such as information about energy and angles, as well as the classification of events to identify particles, using a model         built on the basis of the PointNet architecture.

projects:
  - project_title: Using Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Denoising Tracks from AT-TPC Detector
  project_goal: >
    Preliminary work in Dr. Kuchera’s group investigated using diffusion probabilistic models (dpm) as a surrogate simulator for generating point clouds from         the AT-TPC detector. I propose to continue this idea, but in order to denoise and clean charged particle tracks recorded by the AT-TPC detector. We plan to
    model the problem as unpaired, event-to-event domain translation. One domain would comprise AT-TPC events generated via simulation; the other would comprise       events recorded during actual experiments with the detector. We expect the trained model to be able to remove noise from tracks.
