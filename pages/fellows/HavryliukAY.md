project_title: <Data Classification with PointNet++ for the Active-Target Time Projection Chamber at FRIB>
project_goal: >
We have an Active-Target Time Projection Chamber (AT-TPC) detector, which
consists of a gas chamber (the detector gas is at the same time the target material), a
source of magnetic and electric fields, and the pad plane on which particles are
detected. The task is to extract information from the data that we receive on the detector, such
as information about energy and angles, as well as the classification of events to
identify particles, using a model built on the basis of the PointNet architecture.
