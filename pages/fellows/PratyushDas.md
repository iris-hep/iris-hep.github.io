project_goal: >
  As an IRIS-HEP undergraduate fellow, my work would involve creating a library of Awkward-Array
  GPU kernels preceded by an investigation into the most appropriate way to translate pre-existing 
  CPU kernels to GPU kernels, with an emphasis on generalizing the translation between the scalar 
  code in the currently existing CPU kernels into vectorized code to be executed on GPUs. At the 
  end of the summer, users of Awkward Array should be able to naively switch between the CPU and 
  GPU backends without having to write specialized code or even leaving the Python prompt.<br/>

  As an IRIS-HEP undergraduate fellow, I will be working on ​uproot, a​
  software for reading and writing ROOT files in Python with the help of   
  the Numpy library. Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, uproot 
  is strictly an I/O library, intended to stream data into other third 
  party libraries in Python. Other ROOT file readers in Python like PyROOT 
  and root_numpy rely on the C++ ROOT implementation but uproot does not. 
  Instead, it uses Numpy calls to rapidly cast data blocks in the ROOT file as Numpy arrays.
