project_goal: >
  As an IRIS-HEP undergraduate fellow, I will be working on ​uproot, a​
  software for reading and writing ROOT files in Python with the help of 
  the Numpy library. Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, uproot 
  is strictly an I/O library, intended to stream data into other third 
  party libraries in Python. Other ROOT file readers in Python like PyROOT 
  and root_numpy rely on the C++ ROOT implementation but uproot does not. 
  Instead, it uses Numpy calls to rapidly cast data blocks in the ROOT file as Numpy arrays.
