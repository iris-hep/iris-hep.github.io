project_title: Developing an automatic pruning utility for statistical models in HistFactory format
project_goal: >
   In pyhf, large-scale statistical models employed in HEP experiments are constructed using a modular approach
   to build a parametrized family of complex probability density functions from more primitive conceptual building blocks.
   It is often useful to make the model more lightweight in order to speed-up the derivation of maximum-likelihood estimates of its parameters.
   What's already available in pyhf is only helpful if one manually decides and specifies exactly what blocks to remove ('prune') from the
   statistical model.

   The goal of this project is to devise, implement, document and integrate into the pyhf library framework a tool
   that will automatically decide how to reduce the statistical model in HistFactory format, given its pyhf-specification
   and some ‘pruning’ criteria for the blocks.
