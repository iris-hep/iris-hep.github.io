project_goal: >
  Investigate post-processing algorithms for the output of graph neural networks for
  particle tracks. Apply traditional graph algorithms and end-to-end machine learning
  techniques to the TrackML and ATLAS datasets to label tracks. This will allow for
  faster processing of particle tracks while still producing meaningful results.
