project_title: Conditional Generation of High-Energy Particle Collisions with Graph Networks
project_goal: >
    Explore applications of Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks in GNNs for conditional generation of jets. This network combines features of both MPGAN and ACGAN, being able to generate a conditional classifier GAN using graph neural networks. The expected outcome is a strong ACGAN+MPGAN algorithm using a GNN to conditionally generate jets with high fidelity.
