project_title: Accelerating End-to-End Deep Learning Reconstruction using Graph Neural
  Networks.
focus-area: ia
project_goal: >
  Currently, most of the machine learning based particle identification techniques
  developed by the CMS and ATLAS experiments rely on the inputs provided by the Particle
  Flow (PF) algorithms to convert detector level information to physics objects. Despite
  the very high reconstruction efficiency of PF algorithms, some physics objects fail
  to be reconstructed, reconstruct imperfectly or they exist as fakes. The end-to-end
  deep learning technique combines deep learning algorithms and low level detector
  representation of collision events. This project aims to implement graph neural
  network (GNN) based deep learning approaches to perform end-to-end tau identification.
  Furthermore, the developed GNN algorithm will be integrated with the existing CMS
  Software (CMSSW) based end-to-end deep learning framework (E2EFW).
