project_goal: >
  SkyhookDM, a performance-critical distributed storage system developed by embedding
  Apache Arrow, is a computational storage system. Small changes in the source code's
  performance-critical parts will often result in significant performance changes.
  It's essential to keep track of these performance changes so that the project can
  become more performant over time and avoid silent performance deterioration.

   To overcome these challenges, the Google benchmark framework can be used to create
  benchmarks (very similar to unit tests) for all the performance-critical parts of
  the source code. These benchmarks can be added as a separate job in the CI/CD pipeline,
  which will get triggered when any particular events like commit/push happen. A web
  dashboard can also be integrated to monitor the performance results of the CI tests.
