project_goal: >
  ServiceX is a distributed, cloud-native application that extracts columnar data
  from HEP event data and delivers it to an analyst. The func_adl data query language
  is used to tell ServiceX how to extract the data (what columns, what simple cuts,
  etc.). The func_adl data query language has two backends that are currently part
  of ServiceX - one based on C++ for ATLAS data and one based on columnar processing
  using uproot and awkward arrays. The C++ backend currently runs only on the ATLAS
  binary format, xAOD. The C++ is generated in python. This project will modify the
  C++ backend to also run on CMS Mini-AOD binary files (Run 1/Run 2), starting by
  concentrating on Run 1. The Higgs-Discovery demo will be used as a guide.
