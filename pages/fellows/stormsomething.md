project_title: Benchmarking Prototype Analysis Codes on the Coffea-Casa Analysis Facility
focus-area: as
project_goal: >
  This project seeks to expand existing demo analyses that use the coffea and cabinetry
  Python packages for high energy physics to build towards the IRIS-HEP analysis grand
  challenge. In particular, it will demonstrate the integration between these two
  tools as well as benchmark their performance by using them to recreate an analysis
  from the ATLAS Open Data. This benchmarking will be done on the newly-developed
  coffea-casa analysis facility and will also serve as a test and demonstration of
  the coffea-casa system.
