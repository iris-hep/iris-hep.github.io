project_title: Accelerating Awkward Array Builders
project_goal: >
     Awkward Array is a popular library for nested, variable-sized data, including arbitrary-length
     lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, to manipulate JSON-like data using NumPy-like
     idioms. This project concentrates on improving the performance of the builders of Awkward
     Arrays by exploiting different techniques including Just-in-time compilation (JIT) to improve
     the performance of interpreted programs. Run-time generation enables detailed specialization
     for higher performance, lazy loading for reduced memory use in large scale projects. The tasks
     include making the LayoutBuilder take advantage of a JIT compiler to become as fast as specialised
     output and to optimise GrowableBuffer and Forth's OutputBuffers. This project will prove to be
     useful in preventing memory leaks, optimised allocation of memory and providing a significant
     gain in speeds.
