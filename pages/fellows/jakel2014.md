project_title: ServiceX Dashboard
project_goal:
    This project will focus on developing a Juptyerhub plugin that will provide users access to a ServiceX dashboard. With this, users will be able to access ServiceX in a convenient manner outside of the main ServiceX dashboard. The goal will be to provide a possibility to monitor all the users' transforms and give access to the dashboard-like functionality that already exists on the website. A stretch goal of the project will be to add more existing features to the dashboard, such as an easier sorting of transforms or access to log forms in case data delivery goes wrong.
