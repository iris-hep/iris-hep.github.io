# IRIS-HEP and Collaborating Projects

A number of employment opportunities exist with the universities involved in IRIS-HEP or closely collaborating projects. If you have a strong interest in challenging computational and data science problems in an exciting research environment, please consider applying! **This page will be updated from time to time, please check back for the latest opportunities.**

## University of Wisconsin–Madison

### Research Computing Facilitator

The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) seeks a Research Computing Facilitator to support the goals of a diverse
set of researchers who use computing for their research. This is an ideal position for an academic researcher who has
used computational approaches in their own work and is strongly motivated to support and empower the work of other
researchers through access to large-scale computing resources.

# Other positions of interest for HEP people

We also list some number of job positions that might be of interest for people
with an HEP background, but which are not directly related to IRIS-HEP.

### Others

  * More in general, many RSE positions beyond HEP can be found on the [US-RSE Jobs page](https://us-rse.org/jobs/) or the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/) for the UK and elsewhere.
