If you have a strong interest in challenging computational and data science problems in an exciting research environment, please consider applying! **This page will be updated from time to time, please check back for the latest opportunities.**

# Other positions of interest for HEP people

We also list some number of job positions that might be of interest for people
with an HEP background, but which are not directly related to IRIS-HEP.

### Others

  * More in general, many RSE positions beyond HEP can be found on the [US-RSE Jobs page](https://us-rse.org/jobs/) or the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/) for the UK and elsewhere.
