[ROOT on Conda-Forge][root-feedstock] is now available!

For High Energy Physics, the go-to framework for big data analysis has been CERN's [ROOT][] framework. ROOT is a massive C++ library that even predates the STL in some areas. It is[^1] *also* a JIT C++ interpreter called Cling, probably the best in the business. If you have [heard of](https://andersy005.github.io/blog/2018/01/20/play-interactively-with-cpp-getting-started-with-xeus-cling/) the [Xeus][] C++ Kernel for Jupyter, that is built on top of Cling. ROOT has everything a HEP physicist could want: math, plotting, histograms, tuple and tree structures, a very powerful file format for IO, machine learning, Python bindings, and more. It also does things like dictionary generation and arbitrary class serialization (other large frameworks like [Qt][] have similar generation tools).

You may already be guessing one of the most common problems for ROOT. It is huge and difficult to install -- if you build from source, that's a several hour task on a single core. It has gotten much better in the last 5 years, and there are several places you can find ROOT, but there are still areas where it is challenging. This is especially true for Python; ROOT is linked to just one version of Python, and the one you get with pre-built ROOT can often be the wrong one. And, if you use the [Anaconda Python distribution][Anaconda], which is the most popular scientific distribution of Python and massively successful for ML frameworks, the general rule even for people who build ROOT themselves has been: don't. But now, you can get a fully featured ROOT 6.20 binary package for macOS or Linux, Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8, from [Conda-Forge][], the most popular Anacanda community channel! Older releases such as 6.18 and 6.16 are also available, although the developers of the conda-forge package have provided quite a few accepted patches into ROOT, so the most recent version is highly recommended.

There is now an also an official [ROOT docker image][] built with Conda-Forge ROOT enabled, `rootproject/root-conda`.


[^1]: Technically, it contains Cling, but Cling is what runs when you run the `root` command.
