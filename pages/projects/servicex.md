[ServiceX](https://github.com/ssl-hep/ServiceX) is a data extraction and
delivery delivery service. Users provide a dataset identifier and a selection
statement that specifies filters and columns. ServiceX brings up parallel
workers to open the files in the dataset and uses experiment approved frameworks
to extract the data and store it in popular columnar file formats for easy
analysis using familiar tooling.

## Benefits
* Service can be co-located with datasets to provide fast and efficient data
reduction strategies.
* Interface is easy to learn and the processes are extremely reliable to make it
easy for analyzers to get their job done without needing to learn complex
libraries and babysit batch jobs
* Extracts data from experiment-specific data formats using approved frameworks.
* Data can be provided as popular and powerful
[Awkward Arrays](/projects/awkward.html)
* Results are cached to allow for easy re-analysis
* Transformers are run out of tagged docker images to allow for precise
reproducibility
* Works seamlessly as a data backend to _Coffea_ and TRExFitter analysis tools


## Performance
Recent testing on 10 TB xAOD input sample where we requested 100 columns from 7
collections (~30% of file). We were able to scale up to 1,000 workers the
[River SSL Cluster](/ssl.html) to get results in less than 30 minutes. Output rate was in
excess of 300MB/s.

## How It Works
The dataset lookup service is extensible and developers can create new services
to meet the needs of a specific community. Currently, datasets can be requested
using a Rucio DID or as a reference to a CERN OpenData dataset. Users can also
provide a set of accessible file URLs.

The files located by the lookup service are passed to transformer workers which
are spun up to filter data and extract columns. These transformer workers run
out of docker images which are based on experiment approved images. Their
operation is controlled by a low-level selection language called
[Qastle](https://github.com/iris-hep/qastle). This language allows for filtering
of events as well as data projections and simple calculations of derived values.

Qastle is useful for concisely communicating these transform requests, however
is not intended for end-users. Instead, there are translators that transpile
high level selection languages. There are currently transpilers for
[func_adl](https://github.com/iris-hep/func_adl_servicex) and for the
[T-Cut language](https://github.com/ssl-hep/TCutToQastleWrapper).

## Architecture
ServiceX uses a micro-service architecture that runs on a Kubernetes cluster.
Users interact with the service via a REST interface provided by a
[Flask App](https://github.com/ssl-hep/ServiceX_App). The app also provides
orchestration of the other components.

The Qastle queries are translated into event framework code by code generator
services. These can generate C++ or Python Uproot code which is executed by
the transformers.

The transformers are launched as an auto-scaling job by the flask app. Each
worker is fed from a transactional RabbitMQ queue.
