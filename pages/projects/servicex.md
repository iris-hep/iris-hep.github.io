Smart data delivery for all of your analyis needs. The user selects the data and columns they want
delivered and receives a unique token to retrieve the output. The service can be used directly from
a REST API, and provides easy-to-use clients for Python and C/C++. ServiceX support multiple
delivery formats and can scale to hundreds of worker nodes to deliver analysis data on demand.
