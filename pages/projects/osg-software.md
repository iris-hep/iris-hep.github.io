The [OSG Software and Release](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/) team produces and supports the integrated
software systems that comprise the OSG fabric of production services.

### Activities

-   **Software curation:** the team works with external software providers, ensures the continued functionality of
    abandoned software, and develops tools to fill any gaps to provide a software stack suitable for WLCG sites.
    This software stack is distributed through packages used widely by the community, such as RPMs and container images.

-   **Integration testing:** the team coordinates tests of the integrated software stack among internal staff, external
    stakeholders, and automated means.

-   **Site documentation:** the team maintains [documentation](https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/) for sites contributing
    to the WLCG.

-   **Registration:** the team provides tools for sites to register services and their downtimes with the WLCG.

### Major Accomplishments

-   **Authentication and transfer protocol transitions:** the OSG Software and Release team has been working with the
    [DOMA group](../focus-area/doma.md) to lead the transition to a bearer token-based authentication and authorization
    infrastructure and HTTP/S-based transfer protocol.

-   **Container images:** the OSG Software and Release team has supported the LHC communityâ€™s exploration into DevOps
    deployment models by distributing select production services as container images.
    In particular, the team developed and maintains the [caching](caching.md) container image used by multiple LHC experiments.
    The team follows a strategy of providing a common base container across all communities, plus community-specific refinements.
    The team currently supports three communities, U.S. ATLAS, U.S. CMS, and the general OSG community, with [caching](caching.md) container images.

-   **Streamlining the release process:** to get new software into the hands of site administrators more quickly, the
    team has implemented rolling-style releases along with a policy to make release candidates available more quickly.
