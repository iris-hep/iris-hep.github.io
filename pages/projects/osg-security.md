The OSG Security team works on supporting operational security for OSG infrastructure, software security,
incident response, and coordination with OSGâ€™s stakeholders in cybersecurity.

OSG-LHC Security collaborates with WLCG cybersecurity groups and stakeholders, including:

*  **WLCG Federated Operations Security Working Group:**
   This group is working to develop a trust model and policies for federated service operations across the WLCG. An example of federated service operations is support of a centralized deployment team for containerized edge services across a federated container orchestration infrastructure.

*  **WLCG Authorization Working Group:**
   This group focuses on addressing authorization requirements for WLCG experiments and WLCG infrastructure. The transition from identity to capability token based authorization is discussed by this working group.

*  **WLCG shared incident response:**
   OSG-LHC security collaborates with U.S. ATLAS Security, U.S. CMS Security, and EGI CSIRT teams to facilitate incident response within the WLCG.

The team maintains [documentation](https://opensciencegrid.org/security/) and [security policies](https://opensciencegrid.org/security/OSGSecurityPolicies/) on the OSG website.
