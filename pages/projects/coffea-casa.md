### About coffea-casa project

`coffea-casa` is a prototype of analysis facility, which provides services for “low latency columnar analysis”, enabling rapid processing of data in a column-wise fashion. These services, based on Dask and Jupyter notebooks, aim to dramatically lower time for analysis and provide an easily-scalable and user-friendly computational environment that will simplify, facilitate, and accelerate the delivery of HEP results. The facility is built on top of a Kubernetes cluster and integrates dedicated resources with resources allocated via fairshare through the local HTCondor system. In addition to the user-facing interfaces such as Dask, the facility also manages access control through single-sign-on and authentication & authorization for data access.

### Recent accomplishments and plans

**Recent accomplishments**:
- Deployed at University Nebraska-Lincoln Tier3, `coffea-casa` facility is ready to accomodate the first CMS users: [try it!](https://cmsaf-jh.unl.edu/)

![Coffea-casa Jupyterlab interface with Dask Labextention powered cluster](/assets/images/coffea-casa-1.png){:style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%"}


**Future plans for 2021**:
- Release Helm charts and other by-products to be deployable on the other facilities
- Deploy coffea-casa functionality at least on one external facility
- Involve more physics analysis groups to use facility.
