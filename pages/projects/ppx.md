`PPX` is a cross-platform Probabilistic Programming eXecution protocol and API based on flatbuffers. It is intended as an open interoperability protocol between models and inference engines implemented in different probabilistic programming languages. PPX is related to [pyprob](https://github.com/probprog/pyprob), a PyTorch-based library for probabilistic programming and inference compilation. See Atılım Güneş Baydin's [keynote talk at ACAT2019](https://indico.cern.ch/event/708041/contributions/3308721/).
