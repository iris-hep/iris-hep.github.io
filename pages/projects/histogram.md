Members of the IRIS-HEP team are working on histogramming technology for Python. The trio of projects are:

* [boost-histogram](https://github.com/scikit-hep/boost-histogram): High performance filling using Boost.Histogram from the Boost C++ libraries.
* [Hist](https://github.com/scikit-hep/hist): Analysis routines and plotting for histograms, built on top of boost-histogram.
* [Aghast](https://github.com/scikit-hep/aghast): Conversions between Histogram formats, such as boost-histogram and ROOT.
