LHC data is constantly beign moved between computing and storage sites
to support analysis, processing, and simluation; this is done at a scale
that is currently unique within the science community.  For example, the
CMS experiment on the LHC manages approximately 200PB of data and, on a
daily basis, moves 1PB between sites.

Historically, this has been done with the GridFTP protocol; as we look
to the increased data volumes of HL-LHC and GridFTP becomes increasingly
niche, the LHC community is looking for alternate mechanisms and protocols
to move data.  The IRIS-HEP DOMA area - in collaboration with the WLCG DOMA
activity - is investigating the use of HTTP for bulk data transfer.

   <p class="card-text">The above graph shows data movement rates (up to 24Gbps) for a single host, achieved during
   standalone tests; a typical LHC site will load-balance across multiple hosts in order to saturate
   available network links.
