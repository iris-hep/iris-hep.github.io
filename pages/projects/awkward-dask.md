First component of the Awkward Array CSSI ([OAC-2103945](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2103945), a spin-off project of IRIS-HEP,
is the development of a new Dask container type representing Awkward Arrays. This work is in development at
[ContinuumIO/dask-awkward](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dask-awkward/) in collaboration with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

GitHub Discussions in the [Planning category](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/dask-awkward/discussions/categories/planning) contain summaries of our
weekly meetings.
