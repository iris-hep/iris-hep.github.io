[Uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot5) is a library for reading and writing ROOT files in pure Python and NumPy.

Unlike the standard C++ ROOT implementation, Uproot is only an I/O library, primarily intended to stream data into machine learning libraries in Python. Unlike PyROOT and root_numpy, Uproot does not depend on C++ ROOT. Instead, it uses NumPy to cast blocks of data from the ROOT file as NumPy arrays.
