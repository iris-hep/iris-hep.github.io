The OSG Network Monitoring team designs, deploys, and maintains an infrastructure for
collecting network monitoring data between LHC, OSG, and other sites around the world.
They help collaborators with monitoring, measuring, and supporting research networks
through network tuning, problem identification, and metric gathering.
The team provides tools and support for researchers, network engineers, and site managers
to better understand their distributed infrastructures, localize problems, and measure performance.

This project collaborates with a number of projects including:

*   **SAND** ([Service Analysis and Network Diagnosis](https://sand-ci.org/), NSF Grant #1827116):
    They provide analytics using data from the OSG-LHC network metrics repository.

*   **WLCG Throughput Working Group:**
    This group manages the perfSONAR parameters, test configurations, and host meshes
    that define which tests and sets of hosts are measured.

*   **HEPiX Network Function Virtualization Working Group:**
    This group explore technology and tools in the area of software defined networking and
    future networking technologies of interest to OSG-LHC and others.

*   **Research Networking Technical Working Group:**
    This group focuses on specific networking technology implementations
    requested by researchers involved in distributed collaborations (primarily HEP but others as well).
    See [their charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4U5dpH556kCnoIHzyRpBl74IPc0gpgAG3VPUp98lo0/).

The team also coordinates (with SAND) a group of undergraduates and graduate students
who are working on network related tools and analytics.

The team maintains [documentation](https://opensciencegrid.org/networking/) on the OSG website.
