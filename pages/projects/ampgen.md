AmpGen is a library and set of applications for fitting and generating multi-body particle decays using the isobar model. It developed out of the MINT project used in the fitting of three and four-body pseudoscalar decays by the CLEO-c and LHCb collaborations. The library can handle the fitting and generation of a wide variety of final states, including those involving fermions and photons, as well as polarised initial states.
Source code for the evaluation of amplitudes is dynamically generated by a custom engine, JIT compiled and dynamically linked to the user programme at runtime, which results in high flexibility and performance.
