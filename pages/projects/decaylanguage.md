[DecayLanguage](https://github.com/scikit-hep/decaylanguage) implements a language to describe and convert particle decays between digital representations, effectively making it possible to interoperate several fitting programs. Particular interest is given to programs dedicated to amplitude analyses.

DecayLanguage provides tools to parse so-called .dec decay files, and manipulate and visualize decay chains.
