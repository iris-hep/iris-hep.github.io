The physics program of the HL-LHC (2026-2040) is not that different
from the physics program of Run 2 (since 2015) in some fundamental
dimensions; for example, the size and physics organization of the
experiment is essentially the same. What does change is the scale
of the total data volume. This allows us to use current practice as
a guide for modeling and “data driven design” decisions in ways that
was not realistic before Run 1 data taking started.

The _modeling_ area of DOMA is thus dedicated to deriving an understanding
of current practice, an understanding of how to extrapolate current practice
in a meaningful way to the HL-LHC, and ultimately the modeling of different
strategies and architectures for DOMA for the HL-LHC to understand the
characteristics of a cost effective and performant computing model 
for the HL-LHC.

Work in this area ranges from “intelligent storage” systems to "regional
caching strategies" to "global replication strategies", and the management
of network and storage assets to support processing. It thus provides the
analytical underpinning of other DOMA projects.
