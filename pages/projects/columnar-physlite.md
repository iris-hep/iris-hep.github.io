ATLAS's PHYSLITE will be the common file format for ATLAS in Run 4 of the LHC [[ATLAS Software and Computing HL-LHC Roadmap](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2802918)].
For it to be usable in the Analysis Systems ecosystem of columnar data analysis tools, it is necessary that the tools fully support i/o and analysis operations on PHYSLITE.
This project will ensure that there is close coordination between the IRIS-HEP Analysis Systems team and ATLAS developers to validate that Analysis Systems workflows fully support PHYSLITE.
