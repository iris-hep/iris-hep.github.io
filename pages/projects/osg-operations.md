The [OSG Operations](https://opensciencegrid.org/operations/) team is responsible for
deploying, configuring, and running the OSG-owned services that contribute to the overall OSG fabric of services.
These central services include the OSG software repositories,
infrastructure for staging and caching data for access across OSG,
the accounting database containing all OSG usage,
and user and systems administrator facing web pages.

## GRACC

[GRACC](https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org) is the OSG accounting system
that tracks usage for all projects that use OSG software or services.
