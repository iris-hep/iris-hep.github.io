`func-adl` is an implementation of a functional analysis description language that is declarative. The project is exploring several different aspects of this:

- The separation between a query language and a complete analysis
- Can a query be reduced to a single abstract syntax tree or DAG computational graph
- Can multiple user-interface languages use the same backend?
- Given that physics is usually to be evaluated in a per event basis, can the user analysis be written in such a way that the user thinks only about single event quantities even though the manipulation is done in a columnar way?
- Can a common query language be used to run on different data formats (binary experimental format, flat ROOT TTree's, and awkward array columnar analysis)
