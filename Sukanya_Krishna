project_title: Particle Graph Autoencoders for Real-Time Jet Anomaly Detection
focus-area:
project_goal: >
 Graph neural network (GNN) based autoencoders can beeffective mechanisms for reconstructing particle jets and isolating anomalous signals from background data. The goal of this project is to investigate different types of graph-based autoencoders as well as randomized neural network architectures, including variational autoencoders or normalizing flows.
 These architectures will then be used to analyze new data sets like the public DarkMachines data set, or more complex CMS simulation to search for new physics.
