  A live hackathon is being organized to develop a versatile hybrid Kubernetes platform 
  tailored for Facility R&D endeavors.   This platform will cater to scalable, low-latency analysis 
  systems, alongside providing persistent infrastructure for notebook-based training sessions 
  focused on ATLAS software tutorials, machine learning, and cutting-edge analysis tools 
  designed for HL-LHC.

  The concrete goal will be to run a variety of scalable multi-cluster demonstrators: 

  * A low-latency, Run 3 type analysis (driven from a notebook)
  * Advanced workflows utilizing the Uproot/Awkward/Dask backend with PHYSLITE
  * Advanced workflows utilizing RDataFrame
labels:
  - training
