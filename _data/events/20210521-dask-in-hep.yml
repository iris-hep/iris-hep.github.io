description: During this workshop, we would like to discuss upcoming challenges and different Dask use-case in High-Energy Physics community as well as deployment methods across HPC, on-premise high-throughput clusters and cloud providers. A key challenge is the integration of interactive scale-out systems within the existing federated scientific grid computing infrastructure.
