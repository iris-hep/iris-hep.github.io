  22nd International Workshop on Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research.
  Foundation Models for Physics - Nexus of Computation and Physics through Embracing the Era of
  Foundation Models: The 2024 ACAT workshop invites the vanguard of computational and physics experts
  to delve into the transformative potential of foundation models. As the intersection between physics
  and computational realms deepens, these advanced models, underpinned by colossal datasets and capable
  of generating nuanced outputs, are redefining the research spectrum and increasingly reshaping the
  way researchers approach complex problems, simulations, and data analyses. As we chart this new
  territory, we'll address challenges and opportunities encompassing integration into computational
  ecosystems, innovative data practices, training nuances, infrastructure evolution, uncertainty
  metrics, ethical dimensions, and collaborative vistas across disciplines.
