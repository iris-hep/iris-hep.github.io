  Join us on Nov 3â€“4 to discuss tools and workflows envisioned for use at the HL-LHC. The Analysis Grand Challenge focuses on running a physics analysis at scale,
  and includes the handling of systematic uncertainties, binned statistical analysis, reinterpretation and end-to-end optimization. In this workshop we are going
  to be showcasing developments within IRIS-HEP and the broader HEP ecosystem.
