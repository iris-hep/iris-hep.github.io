  The NSF funded project FISRT-HEP and IRIS-HEP strives to create a highly
  visible model and framework for future software training evolution within the
  U.S. and international HEP (High Energy Physics) communities. Its plan
  includes a dedicated outreach activity on  software training to the local
  Puerto Rico STEM teachers. The most effective way for FIRST-HEP to reach K-12
  students and parents is to train teachers in the basics of computing and its
  vital role in science. To achieve above goal a two 2-day workshop is
  organized for K-12 teachers at UPR Mayaguez to teach basics of Machine
  Learning. This is 4th workshop in a series that began in April 2019. We
  expect this will encourage the teachers and school authorities to consider
  incorporating the basic software carpentries into the high school curriculum.
