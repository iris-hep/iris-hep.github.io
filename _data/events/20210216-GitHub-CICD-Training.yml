description: This is the second fully virtual HEP Software Foundation (HSF) training event on the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, but this time with GitHub Actions. Continuous Integration (CI) is the concept of literal continuous integration of code changes. That is, every time a contributor (student, colleague, random bystander) provides new changes to your codebase, those changes are tested to make sure they don’t “break” anything. Continuous Deployment (CD), similarly, is the literal continuous deployment of code changes. That means that, assuming the CI passes, you’d like to automatically deploy those changes.
