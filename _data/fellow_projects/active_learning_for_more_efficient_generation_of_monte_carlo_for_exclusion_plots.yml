title: Active learning for more efficient generation of Monte Carlo for exclusion plots
description: >
  An [active learning algorithm called has been developed](https://indico.cern.ch/event/708041/contributions/3269754/)
  to make smart choices for parameters of signal Monte Carlo (eg. for a SUSY scan)
  that requires many fewer signal samples for producing a quality exclusion contour.
  Project would be to interface [excursion](https://github.com/diana-hep/excursion)  with
  either the ATLAS or CMS production system and REANA/RECAST. Ideally, excursion algorithm
  would run on a machine with a GPU and be upgraded to include advances in scalable
  Gaussian Processes (eg. [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai)).
