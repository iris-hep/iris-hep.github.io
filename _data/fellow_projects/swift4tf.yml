title: Swift for TensorFlow in HEP
description: >
  Recently, Google announced a project of using Swift for TensorFlow (Swift4TF)
  as a next generation system for Deep Learning and differentiable computing. We would
  like to explore Swift4TF in context of HEP, build ML model using one of the CMS
  use-cases, and benchmark it against transitional Python based frameworks (PyTorch,
  Kears+TF, etc.).  In particular, we would like to understand if Swift4TF compiler
  optimized model can outperform Python based training on specific hardware resources
  (GPUs, TPUs) and can it provide significant performance boost at inference phase
  using different HEP specific ML models.
