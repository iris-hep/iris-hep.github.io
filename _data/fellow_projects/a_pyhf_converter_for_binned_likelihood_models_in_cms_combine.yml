title: A pyhf converter for binned likelihood models in CMS Combine
description: >
  Binned likelihood models based on template histograms are ubiquitous
  in both ATLAS and CMS. Within ATLAS the HistFactory tool is used widely (sometimes
  from a higher-level tool like HistFitter or TRExFitter). Within CMS the Combine
  tool is widely used. Both produce RooFit workspaces. Recently, the HistFactory specification
  was implemented in a pure python environment called [pyhf](/projects/pyhf.html),
  which can take advantage of GPU acceleration, automatic differentiation, etc. via
  backends like TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, etc. In addition, the pyhf model uses a
  JSON schema which has benefits for digital publishing and reinterpretation. We seek
  a fellow to develop a to converter for binned template likelihoods from the CMS
  Combine syntax to the pyhf specification and develop some tools to perform comparisons
  between the two models.
