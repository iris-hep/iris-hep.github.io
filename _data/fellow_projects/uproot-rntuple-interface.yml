title: Reading (and possibly writing) RNTuples in Uproot
description: >
  [Uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot4#readme) is a Python library that
  reads and writes ROOT files, the file format for nearly all particle physics data.
  RNTuple is a new, fully columnar data format for ROOT, which is intended as the
  eventual replacement for TTree ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07669),
  [plans](https://indico.jlab.org/event/420/contributions/7701/), and
  [spec](https://github.com/jblomer/root/blob/ntuple-binary-format-v1/tree/ntuple/v7/doc/specifications.md)).
  Thanks to its columnar structure, data structures of any complexity can be
  zero-copy converted (apart from decompression) into
  [Awkward Arrays](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#readme). In this
  project, the successful candidate would develop the interface code in Uproot to
  read RNTuple data into Awkward Arrays. If time permits, the candidate may attempt
  to implement RNTuple-writing and RNTuple reading in sister projects in Julia-lang
  as well.
