title: Benchmarking of prototype analysis system components
description: >
  The [Analysis Grand Challenge](https://iris-hep.org/grand-challenges.html#analysis-grand-challenge)
  of IRIS-HEP focuses on performing a high energy physics analysis at scale, including
  all relevant features encountered by analyzers in this context. It is performed using
  tools and technologies developed within both IRIS-HEP and the broader community,
  making use of the Python ecosystem and the required cyberinfrastructure to run at
  scale. This project will happen after a first preliminary benchmarking has been
  performed, and it will build on that: the prospective fellow will use pieces of an
  example physics analysis to study the performance of different system components in
  more detail. Fellows are expected to have prior Python experience and interest in
  working with a diverse stack of analysis tools available in the ecosystem.
