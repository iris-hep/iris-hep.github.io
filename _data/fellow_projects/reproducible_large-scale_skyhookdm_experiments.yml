title: Reproducible, large-scale SkyhookDM experiments
description: >
  SkyhookDM is a storage system that allows users to transparently grow
  and shrink their data storage and processing needs as demands change. SkyhookDM
  utilizes and extends the Ceph distributed object storage platform with customized
  C++  object classes  that enable database operations such as `SELECT`, `PROJECT`,
  `AGGREGATE` to be offloaded directly into the object storage layer, allowing applications
  to efficiently query multi-dimensional arrays (HDF5, ROOT, among other formats are
  supported). The aim of this project is to implement and automate large-scale tests
  on CloudLab, GCP, AWS, and MS Azure, by benchmarking SkyhookDM at the 10's of terabyte
  scale over the various supported data formats.
