title: Advancing the Hist library
description: >
  Recent developments in Scikit-HEP libraries have enabled fast, efficient
  histogramming powered by boost-histogram using the hist library and fitting
  into a larger ecosystem of plotters and users. The Hist library already
  provides useful shortcuts for plotting and profiles; however, there are a lot
  of features still missing that would benefit analyses. Some of these include
  statistical functions, like TEfficiency from ROOT, better serialization,
  implicit multithreading based on the user's hardware, auto-scaling for the
  reprs, and integration with fitters. Also improved documentation and
  tutorials are needed.
