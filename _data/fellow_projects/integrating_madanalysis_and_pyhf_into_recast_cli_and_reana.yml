title: Integrating MadAnalysis and pyhf into RECAST_cli and REANA
description: >
  RECAST is a framework for systematic reinterpretation of Analyses prepared
  at the LHC using computational workflows. The workflows can run locally, or on
  REANA, a cloud-native distributed application. It consists of a public and private
  web-services, the "Frontend" and "Control Plane" components respectively, for
  managing reinterpretation requests from the phenomenology community. A RECAST_cli
  (command line interface) for truth reinterpretation, based on the Rivet package,
  has been previously developed. In its current state, the truth reinterpretation
  runs only on the user's local machine. The goal of this project is three fold:
  add new backends to the RECAST_cli besides Rivet (e.g. MadAnalsyis), add alternative
  statistical tools (e.g. pyhf), and to run the workflows in REANA in the cloud.
