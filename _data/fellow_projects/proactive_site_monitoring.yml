title: Proactive Site Monitoring
description: >
  A site on the Open Science Grid can malfunction for numerous reasons.  One
  of the best ways to spot an issue with a site is to watch for changes in a site’s
  accounting data.  Further, accounting data is vitally important for WLCG pledge
  and MOU calculations.  It is simple to check for sites that stop reporting completely,
  but it is difficult to watch for sites that only partially malfunction.  This project
  would entail creating a proactive monitoring suite that would alert OSG operations
  of malfunctioning sites.  Using outlier detection, The monitoring suite would watch
  for significant changes in the accounting information for VOs at all OSG connected
  clusters.  The alerting would notify OSG operators of the outlier for further analysis.
