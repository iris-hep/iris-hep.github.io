title: Efficient implementation of algorithms to reconstruct charged particles trajectories
description: >
  Reconstruction of charged particle trajectories in a magnetic field is
  a common technique used by many high-energy physics experiments to estimate the
  momentum of produced particles.  [ACTS](https://acts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  is a software library aiming to provide cross-experiment support for charged track
  reconstruction algorithm. Written in modern C++, ACTS is designed to be as efficient
  as possible while still allowing maximum adaptability to the different needs of
  experiment-specific software. This project aims to improve existing algorithms and
  implement new, cutting edge techniques including machine learning models and GPU-accelerated
  algorithms within the ACTS framework.
