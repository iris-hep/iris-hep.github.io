title: Histograms using Numba
description: >
  Recent developments in Scikit-HEP libraries have enabled fast, efficient
  histogramming powered by boost-histogram using the hist library and fitting
  into a larger ecosystem of plotters and users. One key feature in enabling a
  fully Numba-enabled event loop for analyses is the histogramming step - most
  loops read (awkward) data, perform operations (including with vectors), and
  then fill a histogram. The awkward and vector portions are developed or
  mostly devleped, leaving the histogramming step as the one element missing
  from a fully Numba enabled eventloop. This project will investigate ways to
  enable a fill from inside the LLVM Numba loop without stepping through
  Python, with the goal of providing first class Numba support for
  boost-histogram.
