title: Interactive C++ for ML (not sure if we should add ML here, we will need to get over tons of applications)

description: >
  Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. Cling realizes the read-eval-print loop (REPL) concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses its strengths such as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics. The LLVM-based C++ interpreter has enabled interactive C++ coding environments, whether in a standalone shell or a Jupyter notebook environment in xeus-cling.

  In this project we aim to demonstrate that interactive C++ is useful with data analysis tools outside of the field of HEP. For example, prototype implementations for Pytorch have been successfully completed.[See this link](https://krshrimali.github.io/posts/2019/08/setting-up-jupyter-notebook-xeus-cling-for-libtorch-and-opencv-libraries/)

  The project deliverables are:
  * Demonstrate that we can build and use PyTorch programs with Cling in Jupyter notebook.
  * Develop several non-trivial ML tutorials using interactive C++ in Jupyter
  * Experiment with automatic differentiation via Clad of PyTorch codes

  Candidate requirements:
  * Experience with C++, Jupyter notebooks and Conda are desirable
  * Experience with ML Interest in exploring the intersection of data science and interactive C++.
