title: Prototyping of a US-CMS Data Lake
description: >
  A federated data concept ("Data Lake") has been proposed by US-CMS as a scalable
  solution that enables HL-LHC scaling of the US-CMS data distribution infrastructure.
  In particular, it would lower operational costs and allow better network capacity
  management while maintaining overall CPU efficiency. This project involves the
  implementation and performance evaluation of a Data Lake prototype, using resources
  at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and Pacific Research Platform (PRP).
