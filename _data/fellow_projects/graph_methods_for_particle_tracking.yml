title: "**Graph Methods for Particle Tracking**"
description: "Particle track reconstruction is a critical software component for meeting the physics goals of the HL-LHC.This project uses Graph based learning methods to address this problem; the overall goal is to do acceleratedtrack-seeding at the trigger level by using Graph Neural Networks to construct tracklets in the ATLAS/CMS pixeldetectors and implementing the algorithms on dedicated FPGAs. There are two areas within this work that afellow could contribute to (and this project could support two separate fellows depending on interest):The first is on the Machine Learning side by implementing, training, and evaluating additional GNN architecturesand graph construction methods. The second is on the hardware and acceleration side by working on translatingthe graph components of these algorithms efficiently onto FPGAs."
