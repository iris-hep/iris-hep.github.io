title: Graph Methods for Particle Tracking
description: >
  Particle track reconstruction is a critical software component for meeting
  the physics goals of the HL-LHC.This project uses Graph based learning methods to
  address this problem; the overall goal is to do accelerated track-seeding at the
  trigger level by using Graph Neural Networks to construct tracklets in the ATLAS/CMS
  pixel detectors and implementing the algorithms on dedicated FPGAs. There are two
  areas within this work that a fellow could contribute to (and this project could
  support two separate fellows depending on interest):The first is on the Machine
  Learning side by implementing, training, and evaluating additional GNN architectures and
  graph construction methods. The second is on the hardware and acceleration side
  by working on translating the graph components of these algorithms efficiently onto
  FPGAs.
