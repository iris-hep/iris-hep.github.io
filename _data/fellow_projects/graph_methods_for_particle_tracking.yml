title: Geometric Machine Learning for Particle Tracking
description: >
  Particle track reconstruction (trajectory finding) is a critical software component for meeting
  the physics goals of the HL-LHC.This project uses geometric machine learning methods
  (particularly graph neural networks) to
  address this problem. There are several possible areas a fellow could contribute to: (a) extending
  work on 'one-shot' tracking architectures that use object condensation or instance segmentation
  approaches to identify tracks and extract track parameters in a single algorithm, (b) contributing
  to an on-going study of equivariant GNNs for tracking by modifying an existing Lorentz-invariant network
  to work with tracking data, implementing rotational equivariant networks for tracking, or studying
  explainability methods for GNNs to characterize the impact of including invariance/equivariance, and (c)
  accelerating these tracking methods by modifying existing OpenCL implementations of the different components
  of GNN tracking (graph construction, GNN inference, and clustering) and linking them together into a full pipeline.
  The specific project will be developed with the fellow. For all projects a knowledge of python is necessary; for projects
  (a) and (b), experience with Pytorch is helpful but not required, while for project (c) some experience with C++ and/or
  FPGAs is advantageous.
