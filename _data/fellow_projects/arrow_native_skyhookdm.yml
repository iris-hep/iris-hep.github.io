title: Arrow-Native Storage with SkyhookDM and Coffea processor Integration
description: >
  [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) is a columnar in-memory format
  for seamless data transfer between different big data systems and mitigates the
  need for serializing and deserializing data and has native abstractions for use
  in Big Data storage systems. We aim to convert [SkyhookDM](http://skyhookdm.com/)
  into an Arrow-Native storage system by utilizing the Object class SDK provided by
  [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) to add a layer in its storage side using the Arrow C++
  SDK to allow querying and processing of tabular datasets stored as objects in Apache
  Arrow format in the storage side. The Coffea framework is a Python package that
  provides several recipes and utilities to aid in development of HEP analysis following
  the columnar analysis paradigm. The goal is to integrate Coffea with SkyhookDM to
  achieve Dask or Spark based parallel computations on ROOT files stored as objects
  in Ceph OSDs.
