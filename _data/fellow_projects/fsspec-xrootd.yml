title: Enable dask interopability with xrootd-accessible storage systems
description: >
  [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask/) is one of the most popular backends for
  HEP columnar data analysis at scale, and backs the [coffea-casa](https://coffea-casa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest#)
  analysis facility. One key feature of dask is the ability to load and save multi-terabyte
  datasets in a convenient manner from various storage systems such as HDFS or S3. This feature is enabled
  by the [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) protocol,
  which abstracts various storage systems with a standard API. A popular storage interface
  in HEP is [XRootD](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/), which allows file-like seek, read, and write
  access over local or wide-area network. XRootD has [python bindings](https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/doc/python/xrootd-python/index.html)
  that are used, for example, in [uproot](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to enable remote reads of ROOT files.
  However, without a dedicated `fsspec-xrootd` binding, dask is not able to easily interoperate
  with xrootd-accessible storage systems. With the coming awkward2 dask integration,
  a fsspec-xrootd binding will be required to have seamless interoperability between
  dask, awkward, uproot, and xrootd. This project would propose to develop the
  fsspec-xrootd middleware software package, and release it as part of either
  the coffea or scikit-hep metapackage.
