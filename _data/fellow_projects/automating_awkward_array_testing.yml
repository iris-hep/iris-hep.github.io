title: Automating Awkward Array testing
description: >
  Awkward Array is a popular library for nested, variable-sized data,
  including arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data,
  using NumPy-like idioms. The Awkward Array kernels are being developed
  for both CPU and GPU. A successful candidate will participate in automating
  the process of writing and testing the kernel code.
  Basic knowledge of Python is required.
  Leveraging on the Hypothesis' ghostwriter the project proposes to automate
  writing the tests developed for both CPU and GPU kernels, measure quality
  and effectiveness of the tests, develop strategies for automating coverage
  and property-based testing. Traditional coverage criteria over CPU programs
  is not adequate over GPU kernels as it uses a completely different
  programming model and the faults encountered may be specific to the GPU
  architecture. Hypothesis is a Python library for creating unit tests which
  are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your
  code you wouldn't have thought to look for. It is stable, powerful and easy
  to add to any existing test suite.
