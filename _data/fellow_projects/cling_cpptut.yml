title: Developing tutorials with LLVM/Cling
description: >
  LLVM/Cling enables a truly interactive C++ coding environment, whether in a standalone
  shell or a Jupyter notebook environment. Experience with other programming languages
  demonstrates that this sort of interactive environment is an excellent tool for learning.
  The project goal is to modernize current tutorial materials, and to create new tutorials
  based on current best practices in C++ using the interactive capabilities of Cling to
  provide an engaging student experience. Students are expected to have prior C++ experience
  and interest in explaining modern C++ constructs to others.
