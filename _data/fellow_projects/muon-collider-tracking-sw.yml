title: Muon Collider Tracking Software
description: >
  A muon-collider has been proposed as a possible path for future high-energy physics.
  The design of a detector for a muon collider has to cope with a large
  rate of beam-induced background, resulting in an unprecedentedly large multplicity of particles entering the
  detector that are unrelated to the main muon-muon collision.
  The algorithms used for charged particle reconstruction (tracking) need to cope with such "noise" and be
  able to successfully reconstruct the trajectories of the particles of interest, which results
  in a very large conbinatorial problem that challenges the approaches adopted so far.
  The project consists of two possible phases. In the first one, we will investigate how the tracking algorithms can
  be improved by utilizing directional information from specially-arranged silicon-detector layers. In the second phase,
  if time allows, we will focus on the optimization of the algorithm and the detector layout in order to take full advantage
  of such information.
