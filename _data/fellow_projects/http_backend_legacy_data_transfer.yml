title: Adding HTTP backend to legacy data transfer server
description: >
  In preparation for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the
  High-Energy Physics community has begun to use HTTP as its future bulk data transfer
  protocol. To assist LHC sites with the transition to HTTP, the Open Science Grid
  (OSG) would like to develop and deploy a new backend to the legacy data transfer
  server (based on Globus GridFTP) that can read and write over HTTP. We seek a fellow
  to help us prototype an implementation and demonstrate the ability to provide transfer
  connectivity between a source GridFTP and a destination HTTP server.
