title: Automating multi-container tests
description: >
  The Open Science Grid (OSG) offers an integrated software stack used
  by the High-Energy Physics community to meet their computing needs. As container
  images and orchestration technologies grow in popularity, the OSG is exploring software
  distribution and deployment through these methods, and need testing coverage to
  be able to develop its software with confidence. We seek a fellow to join us in
  developing a nightly testing pipeline that verifies end-to-end functionality of
  a multi-container OSG site.
