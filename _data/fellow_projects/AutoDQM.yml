title: AutoDQM - an automated web-based tool for data quality monitoring in the CMS detector
description: >
  AutoDQM is an automated web-based tool for data quality monitoring
  in the CMS detector which assists L3 shifters in identifying anomalous
  detector behavior during data-taking. AutoDQM_ML is an accompanying
  python-based machine learning toolkit which provides users with
  tools to train and assess unsupervised machine learning algorithms
  which can be then used within AutoDQM. A student could develop tools
  for streamlining the integration of trained ML algorithms between
  AutoDQM_ML and AutoDQM, develop software for analysis and optimization
  of hyperparameters of the machine learning algorithms (PCAs and
  Autoencoders), or implement new unsupervised ML algorithms in the
  framework. The student should have experience with version control
  tools (Gitlab/Github), linux, python. Machine learning experience
  is a plus as well.
