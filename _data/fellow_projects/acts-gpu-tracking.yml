title: Efficient implementation of algorithms to reconstruct charged particles trajectories
description: >
  [A Common Tracking Software (ACTS)](https://github.com/acts-project/acts)
  is a general tracking software toolkit for High Energy Physics experiments.
  The ACTS collaboration has launched several R&D lines ([vecmem](https://github.com/acts-project/vecmem),
  [detray](https://github.com/acts-project/detray), and [traccc](https://github.com/acts-project/traccc))
  for GPU acceleration by parallelizing the track reconstruction. vecmem is a memory management toolkit
  which provides users with convenient GPU interface. detray is a geometry
  builder which translates the CPU geometry into GPU one. traccc incorporates
  the other R&D lines to demonstrate GPU tracking pipeline which includes hit
  clusterization, seed finding, and Kalman filtering. We seek for candidates who can
  contribute to the traccc project. The examples of possible projects are (1) the development of
  traccc algorithm, (2) the measurement and optimization of tracking performance, and
  (3) the acceleration of existing algorithms by using a caching allocator or realizing
  multi-threaded environment. A proper project will be assigned to the fellow based on their
  skill set and research interest. The successful candidates need a C++ programming skill,
  while experience on GPU APIs such as CUDA and SYCL will be advantageous.
