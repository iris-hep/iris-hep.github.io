title: Enabling support for MiniAOD Transformer for ServiceX Data Delivery Service
description: >
  ServiceX is a distributed, cloud-native application that extracts columnar data
  from HEP event data and delivers it to an analyst.
  The func_adl data query language is used to tell ServiceX how to extract the data
  (the columns, simple cuts, etc.). The func_adl data query language has two backends
  that are currently part of ServiceX - one based on C++ for ATLAS data and CMS data,
  and one based on columnar processing using uproot and awkward arrays.
  The C++ backend currently runs only on the ATLAS binary format (xAOD)
  and CMS binary format (CMS AOD). This project will modify the C++ backend to also run on
  CMS MiniAOD binary files (available publicly as a part of [Run 2 CMS Opendata release](https://cms.cern/news/first-cms-open-data-lhc-run-2-released)).
  The MiniAOD transformer is an important ingredient for a physics analysis workflow envisioned in the [Analysis Grand Challenge](https://iris-hep.org/grand-challenges.html).
