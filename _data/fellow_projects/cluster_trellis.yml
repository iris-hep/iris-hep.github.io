title: Implementing the Hierarchical Cluster Trellis data structure in Julia
description: >
  Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task often used to discover
  meaningful structures in data. Specifically, jet reconstruction at the Large Hadron
  Collider (LHC) involves a hierarchical clustering of the jet constituents that hit
  the detector. We define MAP hierarchy as the maximum likelihood hierarchical clustering
  given a dataset, e.g the binary tree that maximizes the likelihood. Current algorithms
  are approximate and greedy (locally maximize the clustering likelihood). Exactly
  performing inference on the MAP hierarchy and finding the partition function (marginal
  likelihood over all binary trees) by enumerating all hierarchical clusterings over
  N elements is exceptionally difficult because the number of hierarchies grows extremely
  rapidly, as (2N-3)!!. To overcome the computational burden, we introduced in [arXiv:2002.11661](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11661)
  a cluster trellis data structure that computes these quantities in the O(3N) time,
  without having to iterate over each possible hierarchy. While reducing the super-exponential
  complexity, it is exponential and the current implementation is in python [ClusterTrellis](https://github.com/SebastianMacaluso/ClusterTrellis).
  Thus, implementing this algorithm in Julia would make it faster and feasible for
  larger datasets that typically appear in data analyses at the LHC. We would also
  like to take advantage of Julia’s automatic differentiation capabilities.
