title: Matrix Element Method with Deep Learning and Automatic Differentiation
description: >
  The Matrix Element Method (MEM) is a powerful technique for high energy
  physics, but is highly computationally expensive.  Recent advancements in
  applying deep learning to approximate MEM calculations through regression
  have shown dramatic computational time reduction.  The goal of this
  fellowship project would be to explore ways to improve upon the established
  deep learning techniques through contributions to the JAX-based pyMELA
  framework.  If time allows, the project could also incorporate the study of
  the effects of using automatic differentiation to improve the interpolation
  of grid points.
