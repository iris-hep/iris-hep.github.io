title: Optimization of a Higgs to Diphoton NanoAOD (HiggsDNA) framework
description: >
  The Higgs to Diphoton NanoAOD framework is a python-based analysis
  framework for Higgs to diphoton physics in CMS which utilizes
  columnar packages like awkward array. Depending on interest and
  skill set, a student could perform studies in performance optimization
  of the code, develop new tools for visualizing and summarizing the
  outputs of the code, or develop tools for training and integrating
  machine learning algorithms within the framework. The student
  should have experience with version control tools (Gitlab/Github),
  linux, and python (especially numpy, xgboost, or tensorflow).
