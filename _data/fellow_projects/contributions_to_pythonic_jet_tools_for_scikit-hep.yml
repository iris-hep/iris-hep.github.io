title: Contributions to Pythonic jet tools for Scikit-HEP
description: >
  [Scikit-HEP](http://scikit-hep.org) has a tool called [pyjet](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyjet),
  which provides an interface between FastJet and NumPy. The tool was developed prior
  to [Uproot](https://github.com/scikit-hep/uproot#readme) and [Awkward Array](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0#readme),
  which extend columnar (NumPy-like) analysis to High Energy Physics. As of version
  3.3, [FastJet](http://fastjet.fr/repo/fastjet-doc-3.3.3.pdf) itself ships with a
  Python interface, but it was not designed with columnar analysis in mind. Pyjet,
  on the other hand, is incomplete: it lacks some functionality related to jet substructure.
  This project would first investigate the design considerations of the existing Python
  bindings with Scikit-HEPâ€™s Uproot and [Awkward Array](/projects/awkward.html) in
  mind and then contribute to improving the jet tools for the Scikit-HEP ecosystem.
