title: Augment SkyhookDM with in-storage support for a relevant subset of Awkward Array operations
description: >
  [SkyhookDM](https://www.skyhookdm.com) is a storage system that allows
  users to transparently grow and shrink their data storage and processing needs as
  demands change. SkyhookDM utilizes and extends the Ceph distributed object storage
  platform with customized C++  object classes  that enable database operations such
  as `SELECT`, `PROJECT`, `AGGREGATE` to be offloaded directly into the object storage
  layer.  Awkward arrays are currently stored as [lists within Arrow tables](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/datatype.html#classarrow_1_1_list_type)
  inside Skyhook.  This project will investigate and implement a small subset of [awkard
  array](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-array) operations that can be offloaded
  ( pushed down ) into storage for query processing. Common list manipulations that
  perform data reduction such as filters or summary/agg methods will be most useful
  to apply withing storage, since these will reduce network IO transferred back to
  the client from the storage layer.
