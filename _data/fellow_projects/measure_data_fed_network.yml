title: Add network measuring to data federation caches
description: >
  The Open Science Grid (OSG) offers an integrated software stack and
  infrastructure used by the High-Energy Physics community to meet
  their computational needs. To prepare for the orders of magnitude of
  more data from the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC),
  experiments have begun deploying distributed data federations made
  up of caches and origins, to efficiently transfer and reuse data.
  We seek a fellow to join us in adding network performance tooling to
  our XCache Kubernetes deployments.
