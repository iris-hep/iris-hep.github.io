title: Metrics to define user activities and engagement on the various coffea-casa Analysis Facility deployments
description: >
  coffea-casa is a prototype of analysis facility (AF),
   which provides services for “low latency columnar analysis”,
   enabling rapid processing of data in a column-wise fashion.
   These services, based on Dask and Jupyter notebooks,
   aim to dramatically lower time for analysis and provide an easily-scalable
   and user-friendly computational environment that will simplify, facilitate,
   and accelerate the delivery of HEP results.
   The goal of the project is to define a set of various user engagement metrics,
   collected from Jupytehub and other AF services, as well from underlying infrastructure (e.g. Kubernetes)
    and available through Elasticsearch. Expected results are the development of the various metrics,
    a data collection infrastructure for them, and possibly visualization dashboards.
