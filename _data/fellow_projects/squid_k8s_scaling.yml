title: Scaling HTTP caching with Kubernetes
description: >
  The Open Science Grid (OSG) offers an integrated software stack and
  infrastructure used by the High-Energy Physics community to meet
  their computational needs. Frontier Squid is part of this software
  stack and acts as an HTTP proxy, caching requests to improve network
  usage.  We seek a fellow to turn our existing single cache
  deployment into one that can scale horiontally using the same
  underlying storage for its cache.
