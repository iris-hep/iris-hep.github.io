title: Probabilistic Programming for COVID
description: >
  The [PPX](/projects/ppx.html) protocol developed for the [Etalumis
  project](https://phys.org/news/2019-11-etalumis-reverses-simulations-reveal-science.html)
  allows an external inference algorithm to control the execution of a
  simulator.  Originally this was the HEP event generator Sherpa. The same
  tools are now being used to control epidemiological simulators for inference
  and planning (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12432) and
  [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13221)). We seek a fellow to join in the
  effort for PPX / probprog and COVID simulators. The project deliverable would
  involve pedagogical examples and documentation to aid other epidemiologists
  to do the same with their own simulators.
