title: Bayesian Analysis with pyhf
description: >
  Collider physics analyses have historically favored Frequentist statistical methodologies,
  with some exceptions of Bayesian inference in LHC analyses through use of the [Bayesian
  Analysis Toolkit (BAT)](https://bat.github.io/BAT.jl/stable).
  As HistFactory's model construction allows for creation of models that can be interpreted
  as having Bayesian priors, HistFactory models built with [pyhf](https://pyhf.readthedocs.io/)
  can be used for both Frequentist and Bayesian analyses.
  The project goal is to build a library on top of the pyhf Python API to allow for Bayesian
  analysis of HistFactory models using the PyMC Python library and leverage pyhf's automatic
  differentiation and hardware acceleration through its JAX computational backend.
  Validation tests of results will be conducted against the BAT and
  [LiteHF](https://github.com/JuliaHEP/LiteHF.jl) Julia libraries.
  If time permits, work on integrating the functionality into pyhf would be possible, though
  it would not be expected to be completed in this Fellow project.
  Applicants are expected to have strong working experience with Python and basic knowledge
  of statistical analysis.
