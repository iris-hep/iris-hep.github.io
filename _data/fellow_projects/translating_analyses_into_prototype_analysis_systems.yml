title: Translating analyses into prototype analysis systems
description: >
  This project is situated in the [Analysis Systems](/as.html) focus area.
  An existing realistic physics analysis will be translated into new prototype analysis
  systems. The new implementation will be benchmarked and compared to existing traditional
  approaches. An example analysis for this is the search for [Higgs boson decays to
  four leptons with CMS open data](http://opendata.cern.ch/docs/observing-higgs-over-one-petabyte-new-cms-open-data).
  This channel significantly contributed to the Higgs boson discovery in 2012. In
  this project, it will be translated to a new approach, making use of tools like
  [coffea](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea) and [awkward-array](/projects/awkward.html).
