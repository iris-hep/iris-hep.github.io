## My research:

I’m a Research Software Engineer writing and maintaining open-source code in Python and Julia. I focus on building fast, scalable data analysis tools using JIT compilation and GPU acceleration.

## My expertise is:

Building fast, reliable tools for complex data using Python, Julia, and C++, with JIT compilation, GPU acceleration, and large-scale computing.

I have extensive experience with CMS software (CMSSW), focusing on geometry, simulation, and event display. I’m comfortable with C++, software design, numerical optimization, and managing large software projects.

## A problem I'm grappling with:

Optimizing and scaling up nested data computations on GPUs for speed and efficiency.

## I've got my eyes on:

Julia, GPU-accelerated Python, Numba v2


## I want to know more about:

How Rust can complement Python and Julia for fast, reliable physics data analysis.
