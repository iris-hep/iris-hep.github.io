## My research:
Experimental particle physics, research software, and scientific computing.

## My expertise is:
Experimental particle physics, high-energy physics (HEP) software, parallel programming, high-level triggers, and distributed computing.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Preparing for the HL-LHC era: enabling real-time analysis and developing interoperable frameworks for integrating machine learning into HEP workflows.

## I've got my eyes on:
Machine learning and AI algorithms in particle physics, especially for trigger-level analysis.

## I want to know more about:
LLM applications in LHC data analysis, Reinterpretation techniques and global fits in HEP phenomenology.
