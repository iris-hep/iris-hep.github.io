## My research:

I'm writing software for high-energy physics (HEP) as a maintainer for the Awkward Array and dask-awkward project. I'm also a member of the CMS collaboration since 2016 and worked primarily on Higgs analysis with Run 2 data.

## My expertise is:

High performance number crunching Python software, complex data-structures (ragged & nested arrays), and statistical tools for HEP.

## A problem I'm grappling with:

Which tools to use to efficiently develop software. Currently, my go-to editor is VSCode/Zed, but ultimately I'd like to finally spend more time to learn (neo-)vim.

## I've got my eyes on:

Ways to efficiently work with arrays, e.g. JIT compilation for array-computing (JAX, Numba, warp, ...).

## I want to know more about:

Which areas from other scientific fields have similar computational challenges like HEP, and can we find common solutions to those?
