### My research:
The CMS Experiment at CERN, as well as the R&D to prepare the software and computing systems required to operate and produce scientific results from the HL-LHC and other HEP experiments in the 2020s.

### My expertise is:
High Energy Physics (HEP) software and computing, large software/computing projects

### A problem I'm grappling with:
Recognizing echo chamber effects in our thinking and organizations, and finding ways to create more dynamic and sustainable research software collaborations to address our challenges.

### I've got my eyes on:
HEP software challenges in the 2020s...

### I want to know more about:
Places where HEP problems overlap with the larger research community; ideas and prior experience which show how we might collaborate on those problems.<br>
