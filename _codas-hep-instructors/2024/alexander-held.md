### My research:

Higgs physics in ATLAS, statistical analysis (including tooling), end-to-end physics analysis at scale for the High Luminosity LHC (via the [Analysis Grand Challenge](https://agc.readthedocs.io/) project)

### My expertise is:

Higgs physics, statistical analysis, HEP analysis with Python, Scikit-HEP stack

### A problem I'm grappling with:

finding patterns for handling systematic uncertainties in end-user analysis code that are highly readable yet computationally efficient.

### I've got my eyes on:

creating more public resources that show good patterns for end-user analysis workflows and go beyond minimal examples.

### I want to know more about:

the potential sensitivity gains obtained from automatic analysis optimization via gradient descent.
