## My research:
Data management, graph algorithm frameworks (GraphBLAS), and to make all code parallel code.

## My expertise is:
Molecular Scattering, Scientific Computing, Graphs in the language of linear algebra, making music (guitar), and sea kayaking.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
I am on a quest to find one algebra to rule them all.  Many people think it's a relational algebra.  They are wrong.  It's Linear Algebra over sparse arrays.

## I've got my eyes on:
Graph databases, sparse array storage engines, machine programming, and making python a high performance language. New languages (e.g. Jullia) hurt us in the long run.  Let's just make Python fast.

## I want to know more about:
What everyone else is working on/thinking aboutâ€¦ the meaning of life (Monty Python but also philosophically).
