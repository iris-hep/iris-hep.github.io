## My research:
Computational research in applied physics, high performance computing

## My expertise is:
HPC code optimization, parallel programming

## A problem I'm grappling with:
How to introduce performance-oriented techniques into scientific codes without obscuring the science; how to get researchers to care about code quality and maintainability (software engineering)

## I've got my eyes on:
Platform-(quasi)-independent parallel APIs for CPUs and GPUs; Julia

## I want to know more about:
Machine learning (so I'm usually a student here as well as a presenter)
