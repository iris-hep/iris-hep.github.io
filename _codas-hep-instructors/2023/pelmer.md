<h3>My research:</h3>
The CMS Experiment at CERN, as well as the R&D to prepare the software and computing systems required to operate and produce scientific results from the HL-LHC and other HEP experiments in the 2020s.
<br>
<br>

<h3>My expertise is:</h3>
High Energy Physics (HEP) software and computing, large software/computing projects
<br>
<br>

<h3>A problem I&apos;m grappling with:</h3>
Recognizing echo chamber effects in our thinking and organizations, and finding ways to create more dynamic and sustainable research software collaborations to address our challenges.
<br>
<br>

<h3>I&apos;ve got my eyes on:</h3>
HEP software challenges in the 2020s...
<br>
<br>

<h3>I want to know more about:</h3>
Places where HEP problems overlap with the larger research community; ideas and prior experience which show how we might collaborate on those problems.<br>
<br>
