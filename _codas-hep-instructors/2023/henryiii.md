## My research:

I work on pybind11, PyPA/cibuildwheel, PyPA/build, Scikit-Build, and
Scikit-HEP. I work on Histograms, Packaging and distributions, tutorials, C++ -
Python interface, CMake, and GPUs.

## My expertise is:

Python, Python packaging (PyPA member, maintain lots of conda-forge recipes
like Numba), Homebrew, C++ interop (pybind11), Pyodide (web assembly CPython
port), CMake, Ruby, websites, CI, and scikit-build.

## A problem I'm grappling with:

Distributing code (especially compiled python extensions) to students and new
users, including with GPUs.

## I've got my eyes on:

Rust and Pyodide. Also the plans for Numba.

## I want to know more about:

How people are using the tools we are building, how they can all work together,
what challenges have been faced.
