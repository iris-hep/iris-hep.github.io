### My research:

Using graph neural networks for charged particle reconstruction. It's all open source,
check out [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/gnn-tracking/).
If you're interested in contributing, let me know, there's lots to do!

### My expertise is:

Python, machine learning, organizing software training events

### A problem I'm grappling with:

Writing ML frameworks that eliminate boilerplate and make your life easy without
constraining creativity and hackability.

### I've got my eyes on:

Reconstructing tracks with GNNs without edge classification

### I want to know more about:

hyperparameter optimization, how to structure ML frameworks
