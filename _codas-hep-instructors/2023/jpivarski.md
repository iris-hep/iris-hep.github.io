## My research:
Growing the Pythonic HEP ecosystem, particularly as lead developer of Uproot and Awkward Array.

## My expertise is:
Python, vertical scaling, array-oriented programming.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
Involving more people in scientific Python, both as users and developers, bridging Awkward Array with everything, including ROOT and RDataFrame, generalizing its applicability beyond HEP.

## I've got my eyes on:
Julia, portable GPU programming, Arrow, Parquet, Zarr.

## I want to know more about:
What everyone else is working on/thinking aboutâ€¦ the direction of HEP analysis software today.
