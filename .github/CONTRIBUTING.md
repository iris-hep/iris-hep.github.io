### Simple PRs

Many simple PRs can be done just using the web editor. [Adding a new team member, a new presentation](https://iris-hep.org/docs/newteammember), or [a new publication](https://iris-hep.org/docs/add_publication) is easy. You might even be able to [add a news post](https://iris-hep.org/docs/add_news) or [a project page](https://iris-hep.org/docs) without setting up a Ruby environment!


### Development

See the [setting up for web development page](https://iris-hep.org/docs/webdev) (and [other pages in docs](https://iris-hep.org/docs)) to get started with a development environment.
