### Complete the checklist

- [ ] Have you read [the guidelines](https://iris-hep.org/docs/add_news)?
- [ ] Did you add `layout: irispost`, `title:`, and `image` (not too large, please)?
- [ ] Did you add `author:` (if needed)?
- [ ] Did you add `image-caption:` (recommended for accessibility)?
- [ ] Did you add `<!--break-->` after the first paragraph or so, or add `summary:` to the front matter?

You can also add a very wide image with `postbanner:` (optional). There is also a custom figure environment you can use in your article for more images.
